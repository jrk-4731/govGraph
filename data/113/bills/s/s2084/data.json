(Under current law, such exclusion is permitted, not required.)\n\nRequires the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, at the time a proposed rule to designate critical habitat is published, to publish and make available for public comment a draft quantitative analysis that examines the economic effects of the proposed designation, including any effects on possible uses of land and property values, employment, and state and local revenues."
