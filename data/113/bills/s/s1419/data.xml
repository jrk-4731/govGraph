  <summary date="2014-12-10T17:26:04Z" status="Reported to Senate amended">Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Act of 2014 - Title I: Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Technologies - (Sec. 101) Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to redefine "marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy" to include all forms of energy (currently just electrical energy) from: (1) waves, tides, and currents in oceans, estuaries, and tidal areas; (2) free flowing water in rivers, lakes, and streams; (3) free flowing water in man-made channels; and (4) differentials in ocean temperature (ocean thermal energy conversion).

(Sec. 102) Requires Department of Energy (DOE) to consult with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in carrying out the program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application to accelerate the introduction of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy production. Requires DOE to prioritize fostering accelerated research, development, and commercialization of technology.

Expands such program, including by: (1) incorporating technology development assistance to improve the components, processes, and systems used for power generation from marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy resources; (2) establishing critical testing infrastructure; (3) increasing the reliability and survivability of such technologies; and (4) supporting in-water technology development with international partners.

(Sec. 103) Declares that the purposes of a National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Center include:

 advance research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies; support of in-water testing and demonstration of such technologies; and service as an information clearinghouse on best practices for the marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy industry. (Sec. 104) Extends the authorization of funding for the program through FY2018.

Title II: National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers - (Sec. 201) Amends the Federal Power Act to authorize FERC to issue a pilot license to construct, operate, and maintain a hydrokinetic pilot project that meets specified criteria.</summary>
