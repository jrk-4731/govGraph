Requires DOE to prioritize fostering accelerated research, development, and commercialization of technology.\n\nExpands such program, including by: (1) incorporating technology development assistance to improve the components, processes, and systems used for power generation from marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy resources; (2) establishing critical testing infrastructure; (3) increasing the reliability and survivability of such technologies; and (4) supporting in-water technology development with international partners.\n\n(Sec. 103) Declares that the purposes of a National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Center include:\n\n advance research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies; support of in-water testing and demonstration of such technologies; and service as an information clearinghouse on best practices for the marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy industry. (Sec. 104) Extends the authorization of funding for the program through FY2018.\n\nTitle II: National Marine Renewable Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Centers - (Sec. 201) Amends the Federal Power Act to authorize FERC to issue a pilot license to construct, operate, and maintain a hydrokinetic pilot project that meets specified criteria."
