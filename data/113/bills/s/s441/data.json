Requires LEAs to use their subgrants to: (1) inform their states of quality professional development activities that are available for inclusion in the statewide registry; and (2) dedicate at least 25% of each subgrant to quality professional development activities that involve science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and career and technical education."
