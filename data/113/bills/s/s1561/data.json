Requires such a determination to be reported to Congress and include biennial updates regarding the care and maintenance of the chimpanzees and related costs.\n\nRemoves construction and renovation of sanctuary system facilities as a purpose of expenditure of the reserved funds. Requires the use of funds for other compliant facilities to be determined by the Secretary (rather than, as under current law, by the board of directors of the nonprofit entity operating the facility).\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to evaluate: (1) the research status of NIH-owned or supported chimpanzees, (2) the cost for the care and maintenance of such chimpanzees, (3) the extent to which requirements that a nonprofit private entity match funding have been met, and (4) any options for cost savings for support and maintenance that may be identified."
