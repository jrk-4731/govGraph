  <summary date="2014-11-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Keeping America Safe from Ebola Act of 2014 - Defines "covered alien" as an alien: (1) who is a national or a resident of a country designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as one with widespread transmission of the Ebola virus; and (2) whose last habitual residence, or last habitual residence before residence in the United States if the alien is seeking to reenter the United States, was a designated country.

States that a covered alien is ineligible to: (1) receive a U.S. visa or otherwise be admitted to the United States; or (2) enter the United States if the alien was lawfully present in the United States, departed the United States and visited a designated country, and is seeking to reenter the United States. Requires the Secretary of State to revoke the visa of each covered alien.

Exempts from such coverage and requirements: (1) certain aid workers, and (2) persons authorized by the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to travel to the United States for training.

Directs the President to report to Congress every 30 days regarding the spread of Ebola.</summary>
