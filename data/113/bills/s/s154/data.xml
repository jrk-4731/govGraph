  <summary date="2013-01-24T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Preventing the Offering of Elective Coverage of Taxpayer-Funded-Abortion Act of 2013 or PROTECT Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to require the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in entering into contracts with health insurance issuers, to ensure that no multi-state qualified health plan offered in a health benefit exchange provides coverage of abortion. Excepts from such limitation: (1) a pregnancy that results from rape or incest; or (2) a case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, injury, or illness that would place the her in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.

Preempts any state law requiring coverage of or funding for abortions in multi-state qualified health plans.</summary>
