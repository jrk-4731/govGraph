  <summary date="2014-07-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">FLAME Act Amendments Act of 2014 - Amends the FLAME Act of 2009 to revise how the FLAME Funds for the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) are funded.

Makes amounts appropriated to a FLAME Fund available to USDA or Interior for wildfire suppression operations if the department concerned notifies the relevant congressional committees that a wildfire suppression event is eligible for funding from the FLAME Fund.

Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require certain adjustments to discretionary spending limits to accommodate appropriations for wildfire suppression operations in the Wildland Fire Management accounts at USDA or Interior.

Requires adjustments for fire suppression to be made if all amounts in the FLAME Fund established under the FLAME Act of 2009 have been expended and other specified conditions are met.

Amends existing disaster funding adjustments to discretionary spending limits to add provisions related to fire suppression adjustments. National Forest Jobs and Management Act of 2014 - Authorizes USDA to conduct projects that involve the management or sale of national forest material within certain National Forest System (NFS) lands.

Amends the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to authorize the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to obligate funds to cover any potential cancellation or termination for an agreement or contract under such Act in stages that are economically and programmatically viable.

Requires the Forest Service and BLM to notify Congress before entering into a multiyear agreement or contract that includes a cancellation ceiling in excess of $25 million, but does not include proposed funding for the costs of cancelling up to the ceiling.</summary>
