Prohibits the funding of litigation.\n\nDirects the Foundation, according to a specified allocation formula, to award a minimum percentage of funds as grants to coastal states while awarding a lesser percentage of funds to entities including states, Indian tribes, regional bodies, associations, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions.\n\nSets forth a process for the Foundation, with approval of the Secretary, to establish application guidelines, eligibility criteria, and grant approval procedures.\n\nRequires coastal states, as a condition to grant eligibility, to submit a five-year plan (updated at least every five years to continue receiving a grant) to the Secretary for approval after the Secretary has provided an opportunity for public comment. Directs the Foundation to establish an advisory panel to review and make recommendations with respect to the grant applications of other entities."
