  <summary date="2013-06-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Higher Education and Skills Obtainment Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to replace the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits with a tax credit for full and part-time post-secondary students equal to 100% of qualified tuition and related expenses up to $2,000, plus 25% of such expenses as exceeds $2,000 but not more than $4,000. Reduces the allowable amount of such credit to the extent that household income exceeds 400% of the federal poverty line. Repeals the tax deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses.

Expresses the sense of Congress that any revenue saved by the enactment of this Act shall be applied to the currently projected Pell Grant funding shortfall in 2015 and to deficit reduction.</summary>
