Act - Prohibits the head of a federal agency from obligating or expending funds or providing financial assistance for projects for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work unless substantially all of the iron, steel, wood products, cement, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States (Buy American requirements).\n\nAuthorizes the head of an agency to waive such prohibition in certain circumstances.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the Build America Bond program, to: (1) extend permanently the authority to issue such bonds and the authority for payments to issuers of such bonds, (2) reduce the bond holder tax credit percentage, and (3) treat as bonds qualified for the tax credit any bond (or series of bonds) issued to refund a qualified bond if certain criteria are met.\n\nRevises Buy American requirements with respect to federal-aid highways, particularly the handling of waiver requests.\n\nRevises similar Buy American requirements with respect to public transportation and Amtrak, particularly rolling stock. Requires the cost of rolling stock components and subcomponents produced in the United States to increase from 60% in FY2015 by 10% annual increments up to 100% for FY2019 and ensuing fiscal years.\n\nPrescribes Buy American requirements for procurement of a facility or equipment under federal aviation programs similar to those for rolling stock.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to report annually to Congress on: (1) each project for which a waiver of Buy American requirements was issued; and (2) the country of origin and product specifications for steel, iron, or manufactured goods acquired pursuant to each waiver."
