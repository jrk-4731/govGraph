  <summary date="2013-01-30T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Deceptive Loan Check Elimination Act - Amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to prohibit a person from extending any consumer credit through the use by the consumer of a check or other negotiable instrument sent by the creditor to solicit an extension of consumer credit, unless the consumer has requested it in writing.

States that a nonnegotiable instrument that has the appearance of a negotiable instrument in connection with a solicitation for an extension of credit is not an application or request for purposes of this Act.

Shields a consumer from liability for: (1) the principal amount of a negotiable instrument sent in violation of this Act; or (2) any interest, fee, or penalty charged in connection with such negotiable instrument.

 Prohibits any information relating to the liability of a consumer alleged by a creditor to have been established through a negotiable instrument sent in violation of this Act from being either reported to or received by any consumer reporting agency, or from being included in any consumer report.</summary>
