  <summary date="2013-12-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Browns Canyon National Monument and Wilderness Act of 2013 - Establishes the Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado to preserve the nationally significant biological, cultural, recreational, natural, wilderness, historic, scenic, riparian, geological, educational, and scientific values found within the National Monument.

Prohibits the inclusion of any part of the Arkansas River within such monument.

Amends the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 to designate as the Browns Canyon Wilderness specified federal land in Chaffee County, Colorado, comprising approximately 7,900 acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and 2,500 acres in the Pike and San Isabel National Forests.

Allows livestock grazing, if already established within the Wilderness, to continue.

Authorizes measures to control fire, insects, disease, nonnative invasive plants, and noxious weeds within the Wilderness and National Monument.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior to complete a comprehensive management plan for the conservation and protection of the National Monument and the Wilderness.

Releases those parts of the Browns Canyon Wilderness Study Area not designated as wilderness by this Act from further study for wilderness designation.</summary>
