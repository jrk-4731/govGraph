  <summary date="2013-05-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) U.S. ability to attract foreign direct investment is directly linked to U.S. long-term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and security; (2) it should be mindful of the potential impact upon the U.S. ability to attract foreign direct investment when evaluating proposed legislation; (3) it is a top national priority to enhance U.S. competitiveness, prosperity, and security by removing unnecessary barriers to foreign direct investment and the U.S. jobs it creates and promoting policies to ensure the United States remains the premier global destination in which to invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture products; (4) maintaining the U.S. commitment to open investment policy encourages other countries to do the same and enables the United States to open new markets abroad for U.S. companies and their products; and (5) U.S. policies regarding foreign direct investment should reflect national security interests and should not disadvantage domestic investors or companies.

 Directs the Secretary of Commerce to conduct an interagency review of the U.S. global competitiveness in attracting foreign direct investment and report to Congress recommendations for making the United States more competitive in attracting foreign direct investment without undermining fundamental domestic labor, consumer, or environmental protections.</summary>
