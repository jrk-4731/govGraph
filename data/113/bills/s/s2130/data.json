Specifies the period beginning upon enactment of this Act and ending on the date the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Transportation terminates the seasonal vehicle weight limit increase in the North Zone pursuant to the Minnesota Statutes.\n\nDefines the term \"covered logging vehicle\" to mean a vehicle that: (1) is transporting raw or unfinished forest products, including logs, pulpwood, biomass, or wood chips; (2) has a gross vehicle weight of no more than 99,000 pounds; (3) has at least six axles; (4) is operating on specified segments of Interstate Route 35 and Interstate Route 535 in Minnesota; and (5) has obtained the appropriate overweight vehicle permit from the Department.\n\nProhibits this waiver, however, until the bridges along the road segments have been inspected and certified by the Minnesota Department to be structurally capable of supporting such covered logging vehicles."
