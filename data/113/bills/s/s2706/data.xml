  <summary date="2014-07-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act of 2014 - Prohibits the federal government, and any state that receives federal funding for any program that provides child welfare services under part B (Child and Family Services) or part E (Federal Payments for Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV (Grants to States for Aid and Services to Needy Families with Children and for Child-Welfare Services) of the Social Security Act (SSA), from discriminating or taking an adverse action against a child welfare service provider that declines to provide, facilitate, or refer for a child welfare service that conflicts with the provider's sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.

Bars such prohibition from applying to SSA requirements that forbid state entities from denying or delaying adoption or foster care placements on the basis of an adoptive parent's or a child's race, color, or national origin.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to withhold 15% of the federal funds that a state receives for such programs if the state violates this Act.

Allows an aggrieved child welfare service provider to assert such an adverse action violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and to obtain all appropriate relief (including declaratory relief, injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs).</summary>
