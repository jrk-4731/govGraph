  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Livable Communities Act of 2014 - Establishes in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) an Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities (OSHC) to review and coordinate federal policies that:

 encourage locally directed comprehensive and integrated planning and development at the state, regional, and local levels, and coordinated public investments through development of comprehensive regional plans; and provide long-term affordable, accessible, energy-efficient, healthy and location-efficient housing choices for all people, particularly low-income families. Requires the OSHC Director to establish a program to make comprehensive planning grants and community challenge grants to units of general local government or Indian tribes to carry out projects meeting specified criteria.

Authorizes the Secretary of HUD to make or guarantee (up to 75% of) loans to eligible governmental, corporate, or partnership borrowers for infrastructure development projects used to support transit-oriented development.

Requires the Director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes to lead the federal initiative to support healthy housing and eradicate housing-related health hazards.

Requires the Secretary to study how sustainable building features in housing, such as energy efficiency, affect: (1) the quality of the indoor environment, (2) the prevalence of housing-related health hazards, and (3) the health of the occupants.</summary>
