  <summary date="2013-06-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">IDEA MOE Adjustment Act - Amends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to limit the penalty imposed on a state that reduces its level of funding for special education from one fiscal year to the next to a reduction of federal special education funds for one fiscal year. (Currently, that penalty may be imposed on a state for any fiscal year after the fiscal year the state reduces its special education funding.)

Redistributes the federal special education funding that is denied to a penalized state to states that have not reduced their level of special education funding.

Prohibits the Secretary of Education from considering those penalties or redistributions when calculating a state's share of federal special education funds for subsequent fiscal years.</summary>
