  <summary date="2014-12-19T04:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to release the city of St. Clair, Missouri, from all restrictions on the use, encumbrance, conveyance, and closure of the St. Clair Regional Airport.

Prohibits such release from being executed before the city transfers to the Missouri Department of Transportation: (1) specified amounts to be used for capital improvements for airport development consistent with such Department's obligations under the FAA's state block grant program; and (2) for no consideration, all airport and aviation-related equipment of the Airport owned by the city and determined to be salvageable.

Describes such specified amounts as: (1) the fair market value for the highest and best use of the Airport property; (2) the unamortized portion of any federal development grants other than land paid to the city for use at the airport, which may be paid with, and shall be an allowable use of, airport revenue; and (3) the airport revenues remaining in the Airport's account and otherwise due to or received by the city.

Directs the FAA to remove the runway end indicator lighting system at the Airport.</summary>
