Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to: (1) take appropriate actions in the management of current DOD multiyear contracts to minimize the effects of a sequester in carrying out such contracts; and (2) begin new programs, projects, and activities and enter into new contracts for multiyear procurements that are authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013.
