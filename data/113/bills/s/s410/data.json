Makes such tax applicable to transactions by controlled foreign corporations and payable by its U.S. shareholders.\n\nAllows an offset against such tax for contributions to certain tax-favored accounts, including tax-exempt retirement plans, Archer medical savings accounts, health savings accounts, and qualified tuition plans and Coverdell education savings accounts."
