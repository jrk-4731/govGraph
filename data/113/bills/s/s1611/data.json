Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to review and verify the quality and completeness of the asset inventory and strategy of each agency and report to Congress.\n\nRequires such agencies to implement\u00a0their data center consolidation and optimization strategies consistent with federal guidelines on cloud computing security, including: (1) applicable provisions in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and (2) guidance published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\u00a0\n\nAuthorizes the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Secretary of Defense to waive the applicability of any provision of this Act to any national security system if such waiver is in the interest of national security. Requires the Director or the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a statement describing the waiver and the reasons for it.\n\nRepeals this Act effective on October 1, 2018."
