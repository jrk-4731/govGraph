Exempts any such CPSC-promulgated standard from judicial review, a reliance on voluntary standards, and other procedural requirements that normally apply to such proceedings.\n\nRequires helmets that fail to meet standards required by this Act to be treated as a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act."
