Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act of 2013 - (Sec. 3) Establishes the Rocky Mountain Front Conservation Management Area in Montana consisting of approximately 195,073 acres of federal land managed by Forest Service and 13,087 acres of federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Permits the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to Forest Service land or the Secretary of the Interior with respect to BLM land (the Secretary concerned) to only allow uses of the Conservation Management Area that would conserve, protect, and enhance the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations of the recreational, scenic, historical, cultural, fish, wildlife, roadless, and ecological values of the Area. Sets forth provisions for the management of the Conservation Management Area regarding motorized vehicles and vegetation management projects. Allows the Secretary concerned to permit grazing within the Conservation Management Area if it was established before enactment of this Act.

(Sec. 4) Designates specified land within the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana as wilderness. Adds the land to the National Wilderness Preservation System.

Permits livestock grazing and the maintenance of existing grazing facilities to continue if it was established before enactment of this Act.

Authorizes the Secretary concerned to take necessary measures to control fires, insects, and diseases.

(Sec. 6) Directs the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to prepare a comprehensive management strategy for the prevention, control, and eradication of noxious weeds in the Rocky Mountain Ranger District of the Lewis and Clark National Forest.

(Sec. 7) Authorizes USDA to conduct a study for improving nonmotorized recreation trail opportunities, including mountain bicycling, on land within the District that is not designated as wilderness.

(Sec. 8) States that nothing in this Act affects Montana's jurisdiction over fish and wildlife management, including the regulation of hunting and fishing.

(Sec. 9) States that nothing in this Act affects the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) respecting the airspace above the wilderness or the Conservation Management Area nor the continued use, maintenance, and repair of the Benchmark (3U7) airstrip.</summary>
