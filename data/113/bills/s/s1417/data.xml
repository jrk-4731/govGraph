Revises the process for the Secretary to consider the Advisory Committee's recommendations.

Requires the Advisory Committee to meet at least four times per year.

(Sec. 6) Extends through FY2018 a quality assurance program requiring the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to provide for quality assurance of laboratories involved in screening for heritable disorders. Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Director, to also provide for the coordination of surveillance activities.

(Sec. 7) Makes the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Newborn and Child Screening permanent. Includes the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA) as a member of the Interagency Committee.

(Sec. 8) Requires the national contingency plan for newborn screening to be updated at least every five years.

(Sec. 9) Allows the expansion of the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program to include: (1) providing research findings and data for newborn conditions under review by the Advisory Committee to be added to the recommended uniform screening panel, and (2) conducting pilot studies on conditions recommended by the Advisory Committee to ensure that the screenings are ready for nationwide implementation.

(Sec. 11) Requires the Comptroller General to report to the relevant congressional committees on the timeliness of screening for heritable disorders in newborns.
