Replaces such goals with long-term price stability and a low rate of inflation. (Retains the current third goal of moderate long-term interest rates.)\n\nRequires the Board to: (1) establish an explicit numerical definition of the term \"long-term price stability,\" and (2) maintain monetary policy that effectively promotes such long-term price stability."
