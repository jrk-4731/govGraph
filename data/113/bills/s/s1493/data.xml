  <summary date="2013-09-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Medicare Efficient Drug Dispensing Act of 2013 - Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require a prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsor to have in place a payment structure for covered part D drugs that encourages the use of dispensing techniques that foster efficiency and reduce wasteful dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs in long-term care facilities.

Requires a PDP sponsor also to take into account, in establishing fees for dispensing covered Medicare part D drugs to enrollees in a long-term care facility, the utilization of such dispensing techniques to minimize the dispensing of unused drugs, the incremental costs associated with the type of dispensing methodology, and the requirements applicable to long-term care pharmacies.</summary>
