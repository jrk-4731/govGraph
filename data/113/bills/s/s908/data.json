Sets forth requirements for HHT population screening, including requiring the Director of CDC to designate and provide funding for HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence.\n\nRequires the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to award grants for: (1) an analysis of the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) file to develop preliminary estimates for preventable costs of annual health care expenditures associated with untreated HHT and socioeconomic costs associated with preventable medical events among Medicare beneficiaries with HHT; and (2) recommendations regarding an enhanced data collection protocol to permit a more precise determination of such costs."
