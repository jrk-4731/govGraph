Authorizes the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or a state Medicaid program or health department receiving nonidentifiable information from a controlled substance monitoring database to make such information available to other entities for research purposes.\n\nRequires a state receiving a grant to: (1) facilitate prescriber and dispenser use of the state's controlled substance monitoring system, and (2) educate prescribers and dispensers on the benefits of the system both to them and society.\n\n Removes the preferences for grants related to drug abuse for states with approved applications to implement controlled substances monitoring programs.\n\nRevises requirements for studies on progress to include assessment of the effects upon linkages to substance abuse disorder services and interoperability with health information technology systems."
