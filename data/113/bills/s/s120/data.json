(The Program awards scholarships for university study to academically talented, financially needy Pakistani students.)\n\nRequires the additional scholarships to be awarded: (1) in accordance with existing scholarship criteria, and (2) for a range of disciplines to improve the employability of graduates and to meet the needs of the scholarship recipients.\n\n Directs the USAID Administrator to make every effort to award 50% of the scholarships available under the Program to Pakistani women.\n\nDirects the USAID Administrator to designate appropriate USAID officials to provide Congress with briefings on the implementation of these Program requirements.\n\nMakes specified appropriations for foreign assistance to Pakistan that remain unobligated on the date of this Act's enactment available for the additional scholarships authorized by this Act."
