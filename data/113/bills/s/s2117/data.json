Requires TSP participants whose default fund is an age-appropriate L Fund to receive a risk acknowledgement before being enrolled to make TSP contributions.\n\nMakes this Act: (1) effective on the date the Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board issues guidance for implementing this Act, and (2) applicable to individuals who enroll in the Thrift Savings Plan on or after such date.\n\nExtends requirements relating to fiduciary protections to TSP beneficiaries."
