    "text": "Robocall Enforcement Improvements Act of 2014 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to impose forfeiture penalties without first sending a citation regarding the charged violation against persons not licensed by the FCC who violate prohibitions on the use of automated telephone equipment. (Currently, if existing exceptions do not apply, forfeiture penalties may not be imposed unless the person is sent a citation prior to a notice of apparent liability and that person subsequently engages in the same type of conduct described in the citation.)\n\nExpands the statute of limitations period and increases the maximum forfeiture penalty applicable to non-licensed automated telephone equipment violations.\n\nExpands prohibitions on the provision of inaccurate caller identification information to persons outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States.\n\nDirects providers of spoofing services to take such steps as the FCC may prescribe to verify that users do not engage in caller identification information violations. Defines \"spoofing service\" as a service that substitutes, or permits a user to substitute, another name or any number for display as the caller identification information for a call or text message.\n\nRequires the FCC to impose recordkeeping and reporting obligations on spoofing service providers. Authorizes the FCC to subpoena caller identification information transmitted by a subscriber to or customer of the spoofing service.\n\nExpands the definition \"caller identification information\" to include text messages.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that: (1) telecommunications carriers have the legal authority to offer consumers services that block or filter robocalls, and (2) the federal government should encourage telecommunications carriers to develop and implement such services."
