Gives priority to grant applications that target: (1) a rural or urban school, (2) a low-performing school or LEA, or (3) an LEA or school that serves students who are eligible for free or reduced price lunches under the school lunch program.

Authorizes the Secretary to waive all or part of the matching requirement for financially-strapped LEAs.

Directs the Secretary to evaluate the efficacy of the grant program.</summary>
