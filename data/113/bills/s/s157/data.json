The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)\n\n Denali National Park Improvement Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits for specified microhydro projects in the Kantishna Hills area within the Denali National Park and Preserve (the Park) in Alaska. Defines \"microhydro project\" as a hydroelectric power generating facility with a maximum power generation capability of 100 kilowatts and includes any distribution or transmission lines required to serve such area.\n\nRequires the Secretary to complete, no later than 180 days after the submission of a permit application, any analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 respecting any proposed or existing microhydro projects in such area.\n\nDirects the Secretary to exchange Park land near or adjacent to land owned by Doyon Tourism, Inc., located at the mouth of Eureka Creek for approximately 18 acres of land owned by Doyon Tourism within the Galena patented mining claim. Instructs the Secretary to seek to complete such exchange by February 2015. Permits, if the values of the tracts proposed for exchange are determined not to be equal, an equalization of such values to be achieved by adjusting the quantity of the acreage owned by Doyon Tourism.\n\nRequires the land acquired by the Secretary to be administered as part of the Park.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to issue right-of-way permits, subject to certain terms and conditions, for: (1) a high-pressure natural gas transmission pipeline (including appurtenances) in nonwilderness areas within the boundary of the Park within, along, or near the approximately seven-mile segment of the George Parks Highway that runs through the Park; and (2) any distribution and transmission pipelines and appurtenances that the Secretary determines to be necessary to provide natural gas supply to the Park.\n\nDesignates the Talkeetna Ranger Station that is on B Street in Talkeetna, Alaska, and that is approximately 100 miles south of the entrance to the Park, as the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station."
