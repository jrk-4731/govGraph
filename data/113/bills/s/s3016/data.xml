  <summary date="2014-12-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Mineral Materials Contracts Termination Act - Amends the Materials Act of 1947 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to terminate a mineral materials contract and to return to the contract holder any bid deposit and performance bond paid to the Bureau of Land Management if the contract holder submits a request to terminate the contract before production is initiated and before any surface disturbance has occurred.

States that the contract holder's acceptance of the amount returned by the Secretary to terminate the contract constitutes: (1) full and final settlement of the contract, and (2) an agreement not to bring a civil action against the United States with respect to it.</summary>
