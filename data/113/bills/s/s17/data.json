Subjects such authority to the approval of Congress.\n\nProhibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the head of any other federal agency from implementing or enforcing any regulations, proposals, or actions establishing any carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions reductions until the Administrator, the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, and the Secretary of Commerce certify in writing that the People's Republic of China, India, and the Russian Federation have proposed, implemented, and enforced measures requiring substantially similar reductions.\n\nNullifies any regulation, proposal, or action in effect before such certification is made that requires any carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\n\nAmends the Clean Air Act to require an economic analysis of any requirement of the Act that results in an adverse effect on employment. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to establish an economic review board to assess such an analysis.\n\nAmends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) to require the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate, upon a state governor's declaration of an emergency, to exempt from the prohibition against taking, and against adverse modification of critical habitat, any action reasonably necessary to avoid or ameliorate the impact of the emergency, including fighting or preventing forest fires and building, rebuilding, or operating any water supply or flood control project by a federal agency.\n\nProhibits consideration of the impact of greenhouse gas on any species of fish or wildlife or plant for any purpose in the implementation of the ESA.\n\nProhibits the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior and any California state agency operating a water project in connection with the Central Valley Project from restricting operations of an applicable project pursuant to any biological opinion issued under ESA if it would result in a level of allocation of water less than the historical maximum allocation under the project.\n\nDeclares that no presidential permit shall be required for a specified pipeline application filed on May 4, 2012, by TransCanada Corporation to the Department of State for the northern portion of the Keystone XL pipeline from the Canadian border to the South Dakota/Nebraska border.\n\nConsiders the final environmental impact statement regarding such pipeline issued by the Secretary of State on August 26, 2011, to satisfy all NEPA requirements.\n\nConsiders approved the route of the Keystone XL pipeline through Nebraska. Declares that no area necessary to construct or maintain the pipeline shall be considered critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.\n\nDirects the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to: (1) reinstate, for at least 10 years, the reservation of use and occupancy and special use permits to conduct commercial operations within Point Reyes National Seashore in California held by Drakes Bay Oyster Company; and (2) renew those reinstated permits for an additional 10-year period upon request by the company or a successor in interest.
