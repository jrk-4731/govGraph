Amends the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary of State to report by March 31, 2015, to Congress on conditions in Hong Kong that are of U.S. interest, and annually thereafter for 10 years or until the Secretary certifies that Hong Kong has held free and fair elections for 2 consecutive Chief Executive and 2 consecutive Legislative Council periods.\n\n Directs the Secretary to certify annually to Congress whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify separate treatment different from that accorded to China in any new laws, agreements, treaties, or arrangements entered into between the United States and Hong Kong.\n\n Exempts from the certification requirement new laws, agreements, treaties, or arrangements that support human rights, rule of law, or democracy in Hong Kong.\n\n Authorizes the Secretary to waive the certification requirement if in U.S. national interests, and with congressional notification."
