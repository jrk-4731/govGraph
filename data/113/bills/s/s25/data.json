(That Act reduced the cost-of-living adjustments from the full Consumer Price Index [CPI] to the CPI less 1%.)\n\nAmends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to replace the requirement to establish a Medicare Improvement Fund with one that requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a Transitional Fund for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform, available to provide funds to pay for physicians' services under part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) to supplement the conversion factor for 2017 if the conversion factor for that year is less than that for 2013. Makes $2.3 billion available to the Fund from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for expenditures during or after 2017."
