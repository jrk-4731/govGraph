Amends the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs Act of 2002 to include mentoring programs in delinquency prevention grant programs.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; and (2) a comprehensive audit and evaluation of selected grant recipients, including a review of internal controls to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\nRequires states, as a condition of receiving juvenile accountability block grants, to provide assurances of compliance with the core requirement of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 applicable to the detention and confinement of juveniles."
