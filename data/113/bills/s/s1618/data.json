Requires such agency program to integrate relevant information from various sources to obtain information relating to any criminal or civil legal proceeding, financial and credit information, public information, publicly available electronic information on social media, and data maintained on any terrorist or criminal watch list.\n\nRequires an agency enhanced personnel security program to conduct periodic reviews, not less than two times every five years, of information to ensure the continued eligibility of covered individuals or agency contractors for a security clearance or access to classified information.\n\nRequires the head of each agency to ensure that each covered individual is adequately advised of the types of relevant security or counterintelligence information he or she is required to report.\n\nRequires the Director to issue guidance defining minor financial or mental health issues.\n\nRequires an Inspector General of an agency implementing an enhanced personnel security program to conduct at least one audit to assess the effectiveness and fairness of the program and to submit the results of the audit to the Director."
