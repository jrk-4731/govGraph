  <summary date="2014-12-02T12:13:50Z" status="Reported to Senate amended">Enhanced Security Clearance Act of 2014 - Requires the Director of National Intelligence to develop and implement a plan to eliminate the backlog of overdue periodic reinvestigations of individuals determined eligible for access to classified information or eligible to hold a sensitive position (covered individuals). Requires such plan to: (1) use a risk-based approach to identify high-risk populations and prioritize reinvestigations that are due or overdue to be conducted, and (2) use random automated record checks of covered individuals that shall include all covered individuals in the pool of individuals subject to a one-time check.

Requires the Director to direct each executive agency, military department, and element of the intelligence community to implement a program to provide enhanced security review of covered individuals not later than the earlier of five years after the enactment date of this Act or the date on which the backlog of overdue periodic reinvestigations of covered individuals is eliminated. Requires such agency program to integrate relevant information from various sources to obtain information relating to any criminal or civil legal proceeding, financial and credit information, public information, publicly available electronic information on social media, and data maintained on any terrorist or criminal watch list.

Requires an agency enhanced personnel security program to conduct periodic reviews, not less than two times every five years, of information to ensure the continued eligibility of covered individuals or agency contractors for a security clearance or access to classified information.

Requires the head of each agency to ensure that each covered individual is adequately advised of the types of relevant security or counterintelligence information he or she is required to report.

Requires the Director to issue guidance defining minor financial or mental health issues.

Requires an Inspector General of an agency implementing an enhanced personnel security program to conduct at least one audit to assess the effectiveness and fairness of the program and to submit the results of the audit to the Director.</summary>
