Upper Missisquoi and Trout Wild and Scenic Rivers Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate two segments of the Missisquoi River and one segment of the Trout River in Vermont as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior as a recreational river.

Requires the river segments designated by this Act to be managed in accordance with the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Management Plan.

Requires the Secretary to coordinate the management responsibilities with the Upper Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic Committee.

Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements for the protection, preservation, and enhancement of the river segments with: (1) the state of Vermont; (2) specific municipalities; and (3) local, regional, statewide, or multistate planning, environmental, or recreational organizations.

 States that the designation of the river segments does not: (1) preclude the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) from licensing, relicensing, or otherwise authorizing the operation of specified hydroelectric projects; or (2) limit the modernization, upgrades, or other changes to the projects. Prohibits resource protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures required by FERC hydropower proceedings from being considered project works under this Act. Permits such measures within the segments.

Considers zoning ordinances adopted by specific towns as satisfying provisions in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act that prohibit the Secretary from acquiring lands by condemnation within a designated Wild and Scenic River boundary when certain local zoning ordinances are in place.

 Limits the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands under this Act to acquisition by donation or with the owner's consent.

Bars the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers from being administered as part of the National Park System.

Directs the Secretary, upon determining that there is adequate local support for the designation of an additional segment in Vermont, to publish a notice of the designation in the Federal Register, designate the additional segment, and administer the additional segment as a recreational river.</summary>
