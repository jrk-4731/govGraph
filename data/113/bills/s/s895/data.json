    "text": "Antimicrobial Data Collection Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA), to develop a research program to study the relationship between the sales, distribution, and end-use practices of animal drugs containing an antimicrobial active ingredient in food-producing animals and antimicrobial resistance trends. Requires the Secretary to analyze data from the program to determine the data's contribution to studying antimicrobial resistance and establishing an antimicrobial data collection strategy.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) report to Congress on the program's research design and goals, including a needs assessment to improve the FDA's evaluation of antimicrobial resistance; and (2) report to Congress and the public within two years with the comprehensive results of the program and recommendations for developing an antimicrobial data collection strategy.\n\nAmends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revise the requirements for the annual summaries of antimicrobial animal drug information, including by requiring the Secretary to maximize the quality, accuracy, detail, and specificity of the data made publicly available in the summaries. Requires the Secretary to conduct an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of and compliance with relevant FDA programs and policies regarding antimicrobial drug sales for food-producing animals, and the use of such drugs and antimicrobial resistance.\n\nDirects the Secretary to publish a final version of voluntary guidance for drug sponsors on new animal drugs and new animal drug combination products administered in or on medicated feed or drinking water of food-producing animals.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to evaluate the FDA's approaches to eliminate injudicious use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals and the effectiveness of the FDA's data collection activities regarding antimicrobial resistance."
