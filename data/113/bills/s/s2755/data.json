    "text": "Overdose Prevention Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to enter into cooperative agreements to reduce deaths from drug overdoses by: (1) purchasing and distributing naloxone (a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin or other opioids, which are drugs with effects similar to opium) or a similar drug; and (2) educating or training the public, first responders, or health professionals on drug overdose prevention or response. Requires the CDC to improve drug overdose surveillance by entering into cooperative agreements to: (1) provide training to improve identification of drug overdose as the cause of death, and (2) establish a national program for reporting drug overdoses.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a coordinating center and develop a plan to reduce drug overdose deaths by educating the public about overdose prevention and recommending improvements to overdose prevention programs.\n\nRequires the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to prioritize, conduct, and support research on circumstances that contribute to drug overdose, drugs associated with fatal overdose, and overdose prevention methods. Directs NIDA to support research on drug overdose treatments that can be administered by lay persons or first responders."
