All-American Flag Act - Requires any flags of the United States acquired for use by the federal government to be entirely manufactured in the United States from articles, materials, or supplies entirely grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Allows the head of an executive agency to waive such requirement upon determining that it would cause unreasonable costs or delays or would adversely affect a U.S. company.

Requires this Act to be applied in a manner consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements.</summary>
