  <summary date="2014-08-26T15:06:27Z" status="Reported to Senate amended">Amends the Indian Reorganization Act to apply the Act to all federally recognized Indian tribes, regardless of when the tribe became recognized. (This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar, which held that the Secretary of the Interior could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been federally recognized when the Act was enacted in 1934.) Ratifies and confirms any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to the Act for any Indian tribe that was federally recognized on the date of the action.

 Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the effects of Carcieri v. Salazar on Indian tribes and tribal land. Requires the Secretary to publish a list of each Indian tribe and parcel of tribal land affected by that decision in the Federal Register and on the Department of the Interior's website.</summary>
