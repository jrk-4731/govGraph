(Sec. 4) Extends the availability of the Do Not Pay Initiative to the legislative and judicial branches and to the states.

(Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on: (1) data analytics performed as part of the Do Not Pay Initiative to prevent and recover improper and duplicative payments, and (2) the metrics used in determining whether analytic and investigatory efforts have helped to reduce improper payments or awards.</summary>
