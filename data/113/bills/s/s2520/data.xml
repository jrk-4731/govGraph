FOIA Improvement Act of 2014 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to:

 require federal agencies to make their disclosable records and documents available for public inspection in an electronic format; require agencies to make available for inspection in an electronic format records that have been requested at least three times (frequently requested records); prohibit an agency from charging a fee for providing records if the agency misses a deadline for complying with an FOIA request unless unusual circumstances apply; prohibit an agency from withholding information requested under FOIA unless the agency reasonably foresees a specific identifiable harm to an interest protected by an FOIA exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law (presumption of openness); require the Office of Government Information Services to offer mediation services to resolve disputes between agencies and FOIA requesters; require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct audits of agency compliance with FOIA requirements; expand the authority and duties of the Chief FOIA Officer of each agency for promoting compliance with FOIA disclosure requirements; and establish a Chief FOIA Officers Council to develop recommendations for increasing compliance with FOIA requirements. (Sec. 3) Requires the head of each federal agency to: (1) review agency regulations and issue regulations on procedures for disclosure of records in accordance with the amendments to FOIA made by this Act, and (2) include in such regulations procedures for engaging in dispute resolution through the FOIA Public Liaison and the Office of Government Information Services.

(Sec. 4) Expands the program for the efficient management of federal agency records to require agency heads to establish procedures for identifying records of general interest or use to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure and for posting such records in a publicly-accessible electronic format.

(Sec. 5) Prohibits the authorization of additional funds to carry out the requirements of this Act.</summary>
