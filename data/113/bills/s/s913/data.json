Limits those assessments, however, to a change of no more than 1/2 of 1 cent per gallon of oilheat fuel.\n\nProhibits any assessment increase unless: (1) it is approved by 3/4 of Alliance members voting at a regularly scheduled meeting, and (2) the Alliance notifies certain congressional committees of the proposed increase at least 90 days before the meeting. Prohibits such assessments from being passed through to, or otherwise required to be paid by, residential consumers of oilheat fuel.\n\nRequires a qualified state association to deposit funds received under this Act in an account separate from its other funds.\n\nDirects the Alliance to ensure that specified percentages of assessments collected for each calendar year are used by qualified state associations or the Alliance to: (1) conduct research, development, and demonstration activities relating to oilheat fuel, including development of energy-efficient heating and the transition and facilitation of the entry of energy-efficient heating systems into the marketplace; and (2) develop consumer education materials.\n\nDirects the Alliance to require that at least 20% of the demonstration cost or commercial application program be provided by a source other than the Alliance.\n\n Directs the Alliance to ensure that heating system conversion assistance is coordinated with administrators of a specified low-income home energy assistance program and with the Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons.\n\nRepeals: (1) the requirement for an annual analysis of oilheat price changes relative to other energy sources (market survey); as well as (2) the restriction of Association activities to research and development, training, and safety matters if in any year the five-year average price composite index of consumer grade oilheat exceeds a certain amount.\n\nProhibits the use of funds derived from assessments collected by the Alliance for lobbying purposes.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Commerce, in the event of noncompliance with this Act by the Alliance, a qualified state association, or any other person or entity, to notify Congress and the Alliance website.\n\nExtends the sunset date for the National Oilheat Research Alliance program to 19 years after the date on which it was established."
