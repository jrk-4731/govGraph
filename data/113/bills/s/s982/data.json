Prohibits the Chief from: (1) implementing or enforcing the restricted area until two years after this Act's enactment, or (2) taking any action to establish a permanent physical barrier in connection with such area. (Excludes the installation and maintenance of measures for alerting the public of hazardous water conditions as such a permanent physical barrier.)\n\nMakes enforcement of a restricted area the sole responsibility of the state in which such area is located.\n\nProhibits the Chief from assessing any penalty for entering a restricted area of public park and recreational facilities at water resource development projects."
