  <summary date="2013-05-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2013 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide for the planning and implementation of an education campaign to inform breast cancer patients anticipating surgery regarding the availability and coverage of breast reconstruction, prostheses, and other options, with a focus on informing patients who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups.

Requires such campaign to include dissemination of the following information: (1) breast reconstruction is possible at the time of breast cancer surgery or at a later time; (2) prostheses or breast forms may be available; (3) federal law mandates that both public and private health plans include coverage of breast reconstruction and prostheses; (4) the patient has a right to choose the provider of reconstructive care, including the potential transfer of care to a surgeon that provides breast reconstructive care; and (5) the patient may opt to undergo breast reconstruction at a time after surgery for personal or medical reasons during treatment or after completion of all other breast cancer treatments.

Requires the information required to be disseminated by this Act to be posted on the Internet websites of relevant federal agencies, including the Office of Women's Health, the Office of Minority Health, and the Office of Rural Health Policy.

Prohibits such campaign from specifying, or being designed to serve as a tool to limit, the health care providers available to patients.

Requires biennial reports to Congress describing and evaluating the activities carried out under this Act.</summary>
