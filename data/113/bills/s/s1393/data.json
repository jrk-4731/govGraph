Makes this Act applicable to any action pending on or commenced after January 1, 2002.\n\nDirects the Secretary of State to report to Congress on the status of access to wartime records and archives concerning the wartime activities of any such railroad that engaged in the deportation of such persons to Nazi concentration camps."
