Requires: (1) CBO to produce an annual fiscal gap and generational accounting analysis within its annual \"Long-Term Budget Outlook\" and post it on the CBO public website, and (2) the Comptroller General to produce a separate similar analysis within its annual \"Long-Term Fiscal Outlook\" and post it on the General Accountability Office (GAO) public website.\n\nRequires the President's budget submission to Congress to include:\n\n a fiscal gap and generational accounting analysis of the full budget proposal; the same kind of analysis of specific policy changes that would impact revenues or mandatory spending by greater than 0.5% of GDP over the following 10-fiscal year period; and the federal deficit, at current spending levels, in the fiscal year that is 75 years after the fiscal year in which the legislation is being considered, as well as the stock of the debt in that 75th year."
