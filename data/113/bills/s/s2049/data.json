Directs the FTC to: (1) prohibit unfair or deceptive assertions in such written communications, and (2) provide education and awareness to the public regarding deceptive communications.\n\nSets forth the enforcement authority of the FTC and authorizes civil actions by states. Establishes civil penalties applicable to state actions."
