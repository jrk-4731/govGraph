 involves the removal of insect-infested trees, dead or dying trees, trees presenting a threat to public safety or electrical reliability, or the removal of other hazardous fuels near certain infrastructure; is intended to treat 10,000 acres or less of public land or National Forest System land that contains threatened and endangered species habitat, or provides conservation benefits to a state-listed species, a special concern species, or candidates for a listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; or is proposed to be conducted on federal land that is adjacent to non-federal land and on which conditions are determined to pose a risk to the non-federal land, or is recommended in a community wildfire protection plan if certain conditions are met. Excludes from treatment under this Act land: (1) that is a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, (2) on which the removal of vegetation is specifically prohibited by federal law, or (3) that is within a national monument.</summary>
