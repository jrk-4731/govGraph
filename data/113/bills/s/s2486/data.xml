  <summary date="2014-06-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Restoring Overtime Pay for Working Americans Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to establish salary thresholds for the exemption of executive, administrative, and professional employees from federal minimum wage and maximum hour requirements (allowing these individuals to receive overtime pay.)

Establishes salary thresholds also for exemption of highly compensated employees from these FLSA requirements, if the Secretary of Labor determines such employees may be exempted.

Prescribes a fine for any employer who repeatedly or willfully violates the FLSA requirement to make, keep, and preserve records of employees and their wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment.</summary>
