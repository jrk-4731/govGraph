  <summary date="2013-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to review the adequacy of the training, qualifications, and experience of each member of the Armed Forces and civilian DOD employee who is currently responsible for sexual assault prevention and response within the Armed Forces. Includes in such review an assessment of the adequacy of the training and certifications required of Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Sexual Assault Victim Advocates by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.

Requires the Secretary, upon a determination that any member or civilian employee responsible for sexual assault prevention and response does not have the training, qualifications, or experience required to discharge such responsibilities, to take appropriate responsive actions that include: (1) retraining or recertification, or (2) reassignment and replacement of the member or employee.

Directs the Secretary, following the review required by this Act, to prescribe in regulations: (1) appropriate minimum levels of training, qualifications, and experience for such personnel; and (2) requirements for improvements in training, including of Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Sexual Assault Victim Advocates.</summary>
