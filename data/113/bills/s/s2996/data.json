Prohibits a lack of evidence of a favorable benefit-risk profile in a broader population from resulting in a denial of approval.\n\nDirects HHS to require: (1) the labeling of a limited population antibacterial drug to indicate that the drug has been approved for use only in a limited population, and (2) submission of promotional materials related to the drug prior to dissemination.\n\nDirects HHS to describe considerations for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of limited population antibacterial drugs and how the limited population pathway can be expanded to other therapeutic areas.\n\nRequires HHS to conduct postapproval monitoring programs to study how antibacterial drugs approved through the limited population pathway are used and to monitor changes in bacterial drug resistance.\n\nAllows HHS to remove the labeling, marketing, and postapproval monitoring requirements of a limited population antibacterial drug if the drug is approved for broader use.\n\nAllows the limited population pathway to be expanded to other drugs intended to treat serious illness beginning October 1, 2016."
