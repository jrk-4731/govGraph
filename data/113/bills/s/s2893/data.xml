  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Workforce Residential Housing Act of 2014 - Amends the National Housing Act to except from the prohibition against the use of houses built with federally insured mortgages for transient or hotel housing certain mulifamily housing that is a short-term residential property, provided that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined that the provision of such insurance is appropriate.

Defines "short-term residential property" as multifamily housing that:

 has more than 50 dwelling units, each of which contains a kitchen and bathroom facilities; provides mailboxes for each unit; rents the units for a minimum stay of seven days; and does not provide food or beverage services, daily maid services, furnishing and laundering of linen without charge, or bellhop services. Directs the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the risk of providing mortgage insurance for short-term residential properties, and (2) report to Congress on whether any additional risk to the General Insurance Fund resulting from the provision of mortgage insurance for such properties is appropriate.</summary>
