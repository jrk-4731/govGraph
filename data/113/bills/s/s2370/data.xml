  <summary date="2014-05-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Orphan Earmarks Act - Rescinds all unobligated amounts of funds earmarked for the Department of Transportation (DOT) if more than 90% of the dollar amount of that earmark remains available for obligation at the end of the 9th fiscal year after it was first made available. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to delay any such rescission for one year if an additional obligation of the earmark is likely to occur during the 10th fiscal year after it was first made available.

Requires each agency head to identify and report every project that is an earmark with an unobligated balance at the end of a fiscal year to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who shall report a listing and accounting for such earmarks to Congress and to the public via the OMB website.</summary>
