  <summary date="2013-06-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Commonsense Contractor Compensation Act of 2013 - Prohibits civilian or defense contracts from allowing compensation of contractor and subcontractor employees to exceed the annual amount payable under the aggregate limitation established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (currently, $230,700). Allows an exception to such limitation for scientists, engineers, or other specialists who are needed to ensure that an executive agency has continued access to needed skills and capabilities.

Requires the Director of OMB to report to specified congressional committees on contractor compensation, including the number of contractor employees hired in the preceding fiscal year who are exempt from the limitation on compensation imposed by this Act.</summary>
