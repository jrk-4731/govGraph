          <text><![CDATA[<p>Expresses the sense of the Senate that the Department of Defense (DOD): (1) should not, as of the date of agreement to this resolution, be granted authority for its requested 2015 and 2017 military base realignment and closure (BRAC) rounds; (2) before being granted such authority, should achieve economic efficiencies by closing and consolidating excess overseas infrastructure and facilities and reexamining relocation opportunities of overseas missions to U.S. military installations; and (3) is unwise to request a BRAC round when the U.S. economy is struggling and negatively impacted communities are fighting to put citizens back to work.</p>]]></text>
