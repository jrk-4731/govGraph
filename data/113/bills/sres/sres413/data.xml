  <summary date="2014-12-09T17:23:25Z" status="Passed Senate amended">Recognizes the designation by the United Nations (U.N.) of April 7th as the International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in Rwanda.

 Honors the memory of the more than 800,000 victims of the Rwandan genocide.

Affirms that it is in the U.S. national interest to work with international partners to prevent and mitigate acts of genocide and mass atrocities.

Condemns ongoing acts of violence and mass atrocities perpetrated in Syria, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan, and elsewhere.

Urges the President to: (1) confer with Congress on an ongoing basis regarding the priorities and objectives of the Atrocities Prevention Board, and (2) work with Congress to strengthen the U.S. government's ability to respond to genocide and mass atrocities.

Supports U.S. and international efforts to: (1) strengthen multilateral peacekeeping capacities; (2) improve civilian protection in areas of conflict; (3) ensure measures of accountability for perpetrators of mass atrocities and crimes against humanity; and (4) strengthen the work of U.S. and international institutions, such as the Holocaust Memorial Museum, to document and prevent mass atrocities and inspire citizens and leaders to confront hatred and prevent genocide.</summary>
