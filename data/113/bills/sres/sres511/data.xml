  <summary date="2014-07-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Encourages corporate, academic, and social entities to: (1) develop an internal rule modeled after a successful business practice, such as the Rooney Rule (requires every National Football League team with a coach or general manager opening to interview at least one minority candidate) or the RLJ Rule (encourages companies to voluntarily establish a best practices policy to identify minority candidates and vendors by implementing a plan to interview at least two qualified minority candidates for managerial openings at the director level and above and to interview two qualified minority businesses before approving a vendor contract) and, in accordance with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, adapt that rule to specifications that will best fit the procedures of the individual entity; and (2) institute the individualized Rooney Rule or RLJ Rule to ensure that the entity will always consider candidates from underrepresented populations before making a final decision when searching for a business vendor or filling a leadership position.</summary>
