  <summary date="2014-05-14T11:25:02Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Acknowledges that section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907 (revoking the U.S. citizenship of women who married foreign nationals) is incompatible with and antithetical to the core principle that all persons, regardless of gender, race, religion, or ethnicity are created equal.

 Expresses sympathy and regret to the descendants of individuals whose citizenship was revoked, who suffered injustice and inequality, and who were deprived of constitutional protections accorded to all U.S. citizens.

 Reaffirms the commitment to preserving civil rights and constitutional protections for all people of the United States.</summary>
