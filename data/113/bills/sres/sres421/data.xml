Recognizes: (1) the 70th anniversary of the Allied amphibious landing on D-Day, June 6, 1944, at Normandy, France, during World War II; and (2) the efforts of the government of France and the people of Normandy to preserve, for future generations, the unique world heritage represented by the Normandy beaches and the sunken material remains of the Normandy landing by inscribing them on the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List.

Expresses appreciation to the members of the U.S. Armed Forces who participated in the D-day operations.

Thanks the young people of Normandy and the United States for their involvement in recognizing and celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the Normandy landings with the aim of making future generations aware of the acts of heroism and sacrifice performed by the Allied forces.</summary>
