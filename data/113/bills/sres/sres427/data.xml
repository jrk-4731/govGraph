Expresses the sense of the Senate that:

 civic education is essential to the well-being of the constitutional government of the United States, comprehensive and formal instruction in civics and government provides students with a basis for understanding the rights and responsibilities of citizens under such government, elementary and secondary schools are encouraged to offer courses on the history and theories of such government, and civics and government teachers are well served by having access to professional development programs that enhance their capacity to provide effective civic education in the classroom.</summary>
