  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that: Vietnam is an important emerging partner with which the United States increasingly shares strategic and economic interests; the government of Vietnam has recently taken modest but encouraging steps to improve its human rights record; the President, with congressional consultation, should begin a process to ease the U.S. prohibition on the sale of lethal military equipment to Vietnam; easing such prohibition with regard to maritime and coastal defense would further U.S. national security interests, but steps beyond this would require Vietnam to take significant steps to protect human rights; and the United States should support civil society in Vietnam, and specify what human rights steps Vietnam should take to continue strengthening the bilateral relationship.</summary>
