  <summary date="2014-01-07T12:13:59Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)

Supports the sovereign right of the people of Ukraine to chart an independent and democratic future for their country.

Urges U.S. and European leaders to work together to support a peaceful and democratic resolution to the current crisis that moves Ukraine toward a future in the Euro-Atlantic community and a long-term solution to Ukraine's economic crisis.

Encourages demonstrators and members of the opposition and civil society in Ukraine to avoid violence and engage in a dialogue of national reconciliation.

Urges all political parties to refrain from hate speech or actions of an anti-Semitic or other character which further divide the Ukrainian people.

Calls on the government of Ukraine to respect the internationally recognized human rights of the Ukrainian people, especially the freedoms of speech and assembly.

Condemns the decision by Ukrainian authorities to use violence against peaceful demonstrators and calls for those responsible to be brought to justice and all detained nonviolent demonstrators to be released.

States that, in the event of further state violence against peaceful protestors, the President and Congress should consider whether to apply targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, against individuals responsible for ordering or carrying out the violence.</summary>
