Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) as the United States combats terrorism in all forms the safety, security, and health of our livestock and agriculture commodities must not be forgotten; (2) research and investment in biosecurity and agro-defense should be supported by Congress; (3) providing the resources for the advancement of vaccines and cures for deadly pathogens and emerging zoonotic diseases is an integral part of homeland defense; (4) the world depends on U.S. agriculture and on U.S. leadership in science and technology; (5) the United States must remain a leader in the fight against bioterrorism; and (6) biosecurity and a strong agro-defense system are achievable U.S. goals in the global war on terrorism.</summary>
