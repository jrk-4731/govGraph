Makes out of order any motion to table such point of order.\n\nAllows any Senator to move to waive the point of order by an affirmative yea and nay vote of two-thirds of the Senators. Makes all such motions debatable collectively for up to three hours equally divided between the Senator raising the point for order and the Senator moving to waive it, or their designees. Makes unamendable any motion to waive the point of order."
