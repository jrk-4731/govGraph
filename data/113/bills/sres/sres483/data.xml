  <summary date="2014-06-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider legislation that sells any federal land and uses the proceeds of the sale to reduce the federal deficit, except for the sale of federal land in a state as part of a program that acquires land in the same state of comparable value or contains exceptional resources.

Permits waiver or suspension of such prohibition, or successful appeals from rulings of the Chair, only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths (60) of the Senate.</summary>
