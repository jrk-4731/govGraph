(Current law applies the child labor restrictions to particularly hazardous agricultural employment, except where the child is employed by a parent or a person standing in place of the parent on a farm owned or operated by such person).\n\nEliminates any waiver of such prohibitions for hand-harvesting of certain crops.\n\nIncreases civil and establishes criminal penalties for child labor violations.\n\nDirects the Secretary to revise federal child labor regulations to prohibit the employment of children under age 18 in duties involving the handling of pesticides."
