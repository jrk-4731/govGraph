  <summary date="2013-08-02T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Coastal States Extension Act of 2013 - Amends the Submerged Lands Act to extend state jurisdiction over submerged lands from 3 geographical miles to 12 nautical miles distant from the coast line of a state.

Authorizes a state admitted subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act to assert its seaward boundaries to a line 12 nautical miles distant from its coast line.

States that any oil lease and natural gas lease executed by the Secretary of the Interior that is in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and which covers an area within lands transferred to states under this Act, shall remain in full force and effect until it either expires pursuant to its terms or is cancelled pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA).

Authorizes a state in whose territory the leased area is situated to grant oil and natural leases in such area.

Prohibits a state from granting a lease in an area transferred to it under OCSLA until the Secretary of Commerce determines that the state has either an approved management program, or is making satisfactory progress in developing such a program, pursuant to certain administrative grant requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.</summary>
