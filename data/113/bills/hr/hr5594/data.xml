  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to:

 suspend from the visa waiver program any country that has identified passport holders fighting with Islamic extremist organizations, including such groups as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and al-Qaeda affiliated organizations; and restore a suspended country's program participation upon a determination by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of DHS, and the Director of National Intelligence of the ability of both the suspended country and the United States to identify, track, and negate the risk of any individual entering the United States from such country under the program. Expresses the sense of the Congress that:

 the Comptroller General (GAO) should review the national security risks associated with the visa waiver program and report the results to Congress; the Secretary of DHS should strengthen the electronic travel authorization system (ESTA), identify any individual fighting with an Islamic extremist organization, and deny that individual the ability to enter the United States by means of ESTA; and the Secretary DHS should expeditiously complete the biometric entry and exit data system.</summary>
