  <summary date="2013-05-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act or CLAIM Act - Urges the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to: (1) adopt a model independent claims adjuster licensing Act meeting specified criteria, and (2) adopt and administer a multi-state examination for an independent claims adjuster seeking to adjust claims in a jurisdiction other than his or her home state.

Authorizes the NAIC to prescribe examinee eligibility requirements, and requires any multi-state examination to require adjusters to demonstrate essential competence with cross-jurisdictional legal and regulatory concepts.

Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) require a state to adopt licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters if it does not have such requirements; (2) limit the right of a state to establish licensing fees or enforce its laws regarding the adjusting of insurance claims, provided that such a fee is uniform regardless of the licensee's state of residence; or (3) affect the jurisdiction and authority of a state insurance regulator to prescribe and enforce its insurance laws, rules, and regulations governing independent claims adjuster activity in its jurisdiction.

Sets forth criteria for state compliance with this Act, including reciprocity.

Authorizes an independent claims adjuster meeting the requirements of this Act to ascertain, determine, negotiate, or settle a claim in a state that is not in compliance with this Act, but only if the adjuster: (1) holds a valid license in his or her home state, and (2) has passed any multi-state examination established and administered by the NAIC.

Prohibits a state from imposing additional requirements upon such an adjuster.

Authorizes an independent claims adjuster meeting the licensure and examination requirements of this Act to adjust claims for losses related to any presidentially-designated major disaster, regardless of the licensure requirements of the state where the disaster is located.</summary>
