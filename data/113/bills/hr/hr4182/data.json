The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nAdds the preservation of historical recreational activities as a purpose of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways in Missouri.\n\nProhibits the Secretary of the Interior from designating management zones in the Riverways, including but not limited to, \"Developed,\" \"Resource-based Recreation,\" \"Natural,\" \"Primitive,\" \"Mixed-use River,\" \"Seasonal Mixed-Use River,\" and \"Nonmotorized River\" zones.\n\nRequires the Secretary to manage the Riverways in a manner that allows the public to engage in recreational horseback riding in areas of the park traditionally used for that purpose.\n\nRequires the Secretary to manage the Riverways in a manner that: (1) allows maximum public access points to the riverways within the park for traditional recreational activities such as fishing, canoeing, kayaking, boating, swimming, gigging, and floating; (2) does not require a permit for a river baptism; (3) does not include the Riverways as part of a \"National Blueway,\" or other similar program; and (4) does not manage lands within the Riverways as though they were specifically designated as wilderness without such a designation.\n\nDirects the Secretary to manage the Riverways to allow the use of motorized vessels in a manner that is not more restrictive than the use restrictions in effect on November 21, 2013. Allows use of motorized vessels in a manner less restrictive than those restrictions.\n\nDenies the eligibility of any area within the Riverways for congressional wilderness designation under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n\nDirects the Secretary to manage the Riverways in a manner that is not more restrictive than the provisions of the general management plan for it in effect on November 21, 2013.
