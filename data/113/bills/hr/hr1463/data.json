Requires, in such case, that the commanding officer (CO) of such member also complete a separate questionnaire containing the CO's observations with respect to the mental health of that member. Requires such questionnaires to: (1) be reviewed and acted upon by trained and certified mental health personnel, and (2) be accorded appropriate privacy under requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996."
