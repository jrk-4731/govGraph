    "text": "Opioid Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 2014 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to states to develop a peer review process to identify and investigate questionable or inappropriate prescribing and dispensing patterns of drugs classified as schedule II or III under the Controlled Substances Act, which are drugs with an accepted medical use that have the potential to be abused and addictive.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary to establish grant programs to: (1) facilitate training to increase the capacity of health care providers to screen and treat patients to prevent drug abuse, and (2) develop continuing education criteria that allow health profession boards or state agencies to certify appropriate education for safe prescribing of schedule II or III drugs. Requires the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration to award grants to evaluate the prospect of state health professions boards expanding the authority of providers to prescribe drugs to treat drug abuse.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to request that practitioners registered to dispense controlled substances screen patients for potential drug abuse before prescribing a schedule II or III drug.\n\nDirects the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider whether naloxone (a prescription drug used to rapidly reverse an overdose of heroin or other opioids, which are drugs with effects similar to opium) should be available without a prescription.\n\nRequires the Secretary to use an interagency working group to encourage states and local governments to increase opportunities for disposal of opiates (drugs derived from opium) and to reduce opportunities for abuse of opiates.\n\nRequires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review federal opioid abuse activities and make recommendations to reduce opioid abuse and overdoses."
