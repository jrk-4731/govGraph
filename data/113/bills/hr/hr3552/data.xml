  <summary date="2013-11-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Emergency Response Improvement Act - Requires the chief executive officer of a state, to be eligible for assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act on or after October 1, 2014, to maintain a State Office of Emergency Management to coordinate the state response to, and to request federal assistance with respect to, an emergency.

Directs the President, if one or more federal agencies provides assistance to a state in response to an emergency, to designate an individual from one such agency to serve as the federal incident commander for that emergency. Requires such commander to meet with representatives of federal, state, and local entities involved in the response and assist such representatives in: (1) creating a response plan that specifies the responsibilities of each entity, (2) designating an individual to lead the response, and (3) drafting and executing a memorandum of understanding with respect to such plan.

Requires the federal incident commander, in the absence of such a memorandum of understanding, to report to the President and recommend if, and to what extent, the relevant federal agencies should be involved in the response.</summary>
