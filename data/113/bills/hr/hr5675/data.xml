  <summary date="2014-09-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Standards Addressing Federal Transparency and Oversight With Evolving Recruitment Specifications Act or the SAFE TOWERS Act - Revises Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements for the hiring of air traffic controllers.

Directs the FAA Administrator to give preferential consideration in the hiring of air traffic controllers to:

 individuals who have successfully completed air traffic controller training and graduated from an institution participating in the FAA's Collegiate Training Initiative program, and have received a recommendation from the institution; and qualified individuals eligible for a veterans recruitment appointment or qualified eligible veterans who maintain aviation experience. Directs the Administrator to revise FAA hiring practices for air traffic controller applicants with the Department of Transportation (DOT) to eliminate the use of biographical assessments or other personality tests that unduly disqualify applicants.

Changes from discretionary to mandatory the Administrator's authority to maintain the Collegiate Training Initiative program.

Directs the Administrator to establish an Air Traffic Control Education and Training Advisory Committee.

Requires the Administrator to take into consideration any locally developed training initiatives for air traffic controllers for use in establishing best practices nationwide.</summary>
