  <summary date="2013-06-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stem Cell Research Advancement Act of 2013 -Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct and support research that utilizes human stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells.

Limits such research to human embryonic stem cells that have been derived from cells from human embryos that: (1) were created using in vitro fertilization for reproductive purposes and are no longer needed for those purposes, and (2) were donated by the individuals who sought reproductive treatment with written and voluntary informed consent for the embryos to be used for research purposes and without receiving any financial or other inducements.

Requires the Secretary to maintain, review, and update as scientifically warranted guidelines applicable to the conduct or support of human stem cell research by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Prohibits the Secretary from using any funds for the conduct or support of human cloning. Defines "human cloning" to mean the implantation of the product of transferring the nuclear material of a human somatic cell into an egg cell from which the nuclear material has been removed or rendered inert into a uterus or the functional equivalent of a uterus. Requires the Secretary to update the guidelines maintained pursuant to this Act for consistency with such prohibition.

Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to include information on human stem cells in the biennial report to Congress.</summary>
