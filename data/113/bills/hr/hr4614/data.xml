  <summary date="2014-05-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Park Partner Enhancement Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park Service, to enter into challenge cost-share agreements and certain cooperative agreements with educational institutions and nonprofits (Park Partners) to advance National Park Service programs and projects.

Includes among these any programs and projects to: (1) manage cooperatively improvements on lands and programs within or related to at least one unit of the National Park System (NPS); (2) assist the National Park Service to plan and construct National Park facilities and trails and restore landscapes and resources within or related to at least one NPS unit; (3) provide educational and interpretive programs and services; (4) develop, distribute, or sell educational and interpretive materials and projects; and (5) raise funds and assets through donation to support such projects and programs.

Allows the Secretary to consider the fair value of services performed by persons who volunteer their services required for the agreement to the National Park Service, and who are recruited, trained, and supported by a Park Partner, as up to 50% of any in-kind contribution of the Park Partner for cost sharing purposes.

Requires any funds donated, proceeds received, or cost-recovery amounts provided through agreements to remain available, without future appropriation, until expended for preservation, restoration, operation, maintenance, interpretation, public programs, and related expenses of the National Park Service or Park Partner.</summary>
