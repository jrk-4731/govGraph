Bars the Secretary from acquiring the land by condemnation.\n\nProhibits activities or uses outside the park from being regulated or precluded merely because those activities or uses can be seen, heard, or detected from within the park, thereby prohibiting this Act from being construed to create buffer zones outside the park."
