Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Personnel Flexibilities Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a system to govern the compensation and performance management of employees, other than senior executives or employees in the Senior Executive Service, holding critical scientific, technical, or professional positions in the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the Department of the Treasury. Limits the number of employees subject to such system to 50% of the Bureau's full-time employees. Requires such system to compensate employees at a level not exceeding level III of the Executive Schedule and to have not less than two levels of performance above a retention standard.

Provides that such system: (1) may not provide for a waiver of employees' rights relating to merit system principles, and (2) must be consistent with collective bargaining agreements and rights.

Requires the Secretary, on the request of the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to disclose information relating to the operation of any compensation and performance management system established by this Act.

Allows the continued use of an existing compensation and performance management system, originally implemented as a demonstration project, so long as such system satisfies the requirements of this Act.

Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs a report on the operation of the system and of ongoing demonstration projects testing the use of a pay and classification system different than the General Schedule for federal employee compensation.</summary>
