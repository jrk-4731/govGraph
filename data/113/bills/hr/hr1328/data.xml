Requires the Secretary to convene a panel of experts to identify the greatest needs and priorities for the conservation of great apes within a year of this Act's enactment and every five years thereafter (current law authorizes the Secretary to convene a panel to consider the greatest conservation needs every two years). Requires the panel to include representatives from foreign range states with expertise in great ape conservation and to consider relevant great ape conservation plans or strategies, including scientific research and findings related to: (1) conservation needs and priorities of great apes, (2) regional or species-specific action plans or strategies, (3) applicable strategies developed or initiated by the Secretary, and (4) any other applicable conservation plan or strategy.

Authorizes the Secretary to pay expenses of convening and facilitating meetings of the panel.

Authorizes appropriations for the Great Ape Conservation Fund for FY2014-FY2018.</summary>
