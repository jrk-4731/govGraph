Authorizes payment of up to 3% of total project administrative costs, fees, and management charges.\n\n Prohibits amounts available to the DOD from being used under such Act to acquire fee title interest in real property for such natural resources projects that are not on a military installation.\n\nRequires the DOD Inspector General to conduct annual audits of natural resources projects funded with amounts available to DOD under such Act that are not on a military installation.\n\n(Sec. 2) Allows the recipient of funds in agreements under the Sikes Act, or other specified agreements with states, political subdivisions, or private entities pursuant to military laws addressing the use or development of real property near or ecologically related to military installations or airspace, to use such funds to satisfy any matching funds or cost-sharing requirement of the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) or the Interior.\n\n(Sec. 3) Declares that this Act expires on October 1, 2019, except that cooperative agreements entered into before such date shall continue as if this Act has not expired."
