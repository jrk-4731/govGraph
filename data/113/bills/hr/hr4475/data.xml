Declares that, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct, any person who manufactures, imports, distributes, prescribes, or administers an investigational drug or device shall not be liable in any action under state or federal law for loss, damage, or injury arising out of, relating to, or resulting from: (1) the design, development, clinical testing and investigation, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescription, administration, or use of such drugs or devices; or (2) their safety or effectiveness.</summary>
