Sets forth selection factors, including by giving a priority to those with a history of knowledgeable, detailed, and comprehensive efforts to develop integrated and adaptive clean water management practices, without regard to the municipality's status in the process of planning or implementing them.\n\nProvides standards for approval of a municipality's integrated plan under the pilot program, including concerning financial capability, prioritization of obligations under the Clean Water Act, and the use of innovative and flexible approaches to meet obligations.\n\nAllows priority to be given to municipalities seeking to develop and implement approaches that adapt to changed or future uncertain circumstances.\n\nProvides additional authorities regarding selected municipalities concerning: (1) extension of the allowable national pollutant discharge elimination system permit term, (2) modification of implementation terms of a consent decree, and (3) additional regulatory flexibility in approving and implementing an integrated plan that includes adaptive approaches."
