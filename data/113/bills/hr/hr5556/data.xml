  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Electronic Health Fairness Act of 2014 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit any patient encounter of an eligible professional occurring at an ambulatory surgical center from being treated as such an encounter in determining whether an eligible professional qualifies as a meaningful electronic health record (EHR) user.

Terminates this prohibition three years after the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) certifies EHR technology for the ambulatory surgical center setting.</summary>
