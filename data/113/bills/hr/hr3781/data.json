Allows the first $10,000 of wages paid to such a recipient to be taken in account for purposes of such credit.\n\nDefines \"qualified unemployment compensation recipient\" as any individual who is certified as: (1) not being a student for at least six months during the one-year period ending on the hiring date, (2) being in receipt of unemployment compensation on the hiring date, and (3) having a hiring date during the two-year period which begins on the enactment of this Act.\n\nDenies such credit unless: (1) the\u00a0qualified unemployment compensation recipient is employed for not\u00a0less than 35 hours per week for not\u00a0less than 1 year, and (2) the number of full-time employees of the employer receiving such credit is increased by 1 for at least 1 year."
