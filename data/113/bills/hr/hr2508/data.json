(The ESSA Capacity Agreement deals with the delivery of potable water that the Band receives from the EMWD and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California pursuant to an Extension of Service Area Agreement with those entities.)\n\nRepeals this Act and voids any related agreements on the later of May 1, 2030, or the day after an alternative date agreed to by the Band and the Secretary, if the Secretary does not publish a statement of findings required under this Act by April 30, 2030. Returns any appropriations and unobligated amounts to the general fund of the Treasury."
