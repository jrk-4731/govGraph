Requires the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote on a joint resolution on the question of whether such report should be disapproved within 90 days of receiving it or such joint resolution shall be deemed passed. Requires the Comptroller General to submit an annual report on such operational control.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to: (1) deploy up to an additional 10,000 members of the National Guard along the U.S.-Mexico border as requested by border states; and (2) provide funds to the governor of a state who submits a state border control activities plan, which is approved by the Secretary, that specifies how personnel of the National Guard of such state are to be used in border control activities. Authorizes National Guard personnel to be ordered to carry out border control activities.\n\nAuthorizes: (1) the DHS Secretary to deploy smart border technologies if necessary to achieve and maintain such operational control; and (2) the Defense Secretary to transfer specified eligible equipment returned from DOD operations to federal, state, and local agencies, with preference to agencies that will use such equipment primarily to strengthen border security.\n\nRequires the DHS Secretary: (1) if such a joint resolution of disapproval on operational control passes, to appoint an additional 1,500 Border Patrol agents; (2) make grants to sheriffs' departments along the border in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California to hire additional deputies; and (3) establish the biometric entry and exit data system required under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n\nAuthorizes the DHS Secretary to make competitive grants for public-private partnerships that finance equipment and infrastructure to improve the public safety of residents of U.S. rural areas near the border by enhancing access to mobile communications for such persons.\n\nDirects the the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to ensure that an individual who is apprehended unlawfully crossing, or attempting to unlawfully cross, the border into the United States is counted only once for purposes of counting border apprehensions."
