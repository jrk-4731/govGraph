  <summary date="2013-01-23T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Restore the Constitution Act of 2013 - Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that any executive order, memoranda, proclamation, or signing statement issued by the President that infringes on the powers and duties of Congress under article I, section 8 of the Constitution or the Second Amendment, or that would require the expenditure of federal funds not specifically appropriated for such executive action, is advisory only and has no force or effect unless enacted by law.

Nullifies any such executive action and prohibits the use of appropriated funds to promulgate or enforce any such action.

Authorizes the following persons to bring an action in an appropriate U.S. court to challenge the validity of any such executive action: (1) any member or either or both chambers of Congress, (2) the highest governmental official of any state or political subdivision if the challenged action infringes on a power of such state under any congressional enactment or relevant treaty, and (3) any person aggrieved in a liberty or property interest adversely affected by the challenged action.</summary>
