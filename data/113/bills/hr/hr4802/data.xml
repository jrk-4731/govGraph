  <summary date="2014-07-22T16:00:05Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 3, 2014. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2014 - (Sec. 3) Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) conduct outreach to all U.S. airports at which the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) performs, or oversees the implementation and performance of, security measures; and (2) give necessary technical assistance to verify that such airports have in place individualized working plans for responding to security incidents inside the airport perimeter, including active shooters, acts of terrorism, and incidents that target passenger-screening checkpoints.

Requires the Assistant Secretary to report to Congress on the outreach findings, including an analysis of the level of preparedness such airports have to respond to such incidents.

 (Sec. 4) Requires the Assistant Secretary to: (1) identify best practices that exist across airports for security incident planning, management, and training; and (2) establish a mechanism through which to share those best practices with other airport operators nationwide.

(Sec. 5) Requires the Assistant Secretary also to: (1) certify annually to specified congressional committees that all screening personnel have participated in practical training exercises for active shooter scenarios, and (2) analyze for those same committees how TSA can use cost savings achieved through efficiencies to increase over the next five fiscal years the funding available for checkpoint screening law enforcement support reimbursable agreements.

(Sec. 7) Declares that no additional appropriations are authorized to carry out this Act. Requires this Act to be carried out using amounts otherwise available.

(Sec. 8) Requires the Assistant Secretary to review the interoperable communications capabilities of law enforcement, fire, and medical personnel responsible for responding to security incidents at all U.S. airports at which the TSA performs, or oversees the implementation and performance of, security measures.</summary>
