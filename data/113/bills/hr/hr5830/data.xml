  <summary date="2014-12-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Grand Jury Reform Act of 2014 - Requires a state to comply with the requirements of this Act in order for it, or a local governmental unit thereof, to be eligible to receive funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.

Directs the governor of a state to: (1) appoint a special prosecutor to present evidence on the state's behalf at a hearing before a judge to determine whether probable cause exists to bring criminal charges against a law enforcement officer who uses deadly force against a person and thereby causes his or her death; and (2) use a random process to select the special prosecutor from among the prosecutors in the state, excluding the prosecutors of the locality in which the death took place.

Requires: (1) the judge to issue the determination in writing and submit it to the chief prosecutor of the locality in which the death took place; (2) the special prosecutor, upon conclusion of the hearing, to submit written recommendations to such chief prosecutor, including regarding whether criminal charges should be brought against the officer; and (3) the court to remain open to the public in such hearing, except as determined appropriate by the presiding judge.</summary>
