Excludes such proceedings from specified laws governing the CPSC's reliance on voluntary standards, the development of consumer product safety rules, and the CPSC's regulation of consumer products in accordance with other laws. Prohibits application of judicial review provisions to any standard issued pursuant to such proceedings.\n\nRequires any failure to meet the interim standard to be treated as a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). Requires any final standard to be considered a CPSA consumer product safety standard."
