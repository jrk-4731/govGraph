Subjects such contributions, on the other hand, to the requirements for deduction as an allowable trade or business expense.\n\nTreats a trust holding the assets of such a pension benefit plan as a tax-exempt organization.\n\nExcludes from wages any payments made to, or on behalf of, an employee or his or her beneficiary under such a plan."
