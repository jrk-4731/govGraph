  <summary date="2014-07-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Value Based Insurance Design for Better Care Act of 2014 or the VBID for Better Care Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a three-year demonstration program to test the use of value-based insurance design methodologies under the eligible Medicare plans offered by Medicare Advantage organizations under part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act.

Defines "value-based insurance design methodology" as one for identifying specific prescription medications, and clinical services reimbursable under Medicare, for which copayments, coinsurance, or both should be reduced or eliminated because of the high-value and effectiveness of these medications and services for specific chronic clinical conditions (as approved by the Secretary).

Directs the Secretary to expand the demonstration program to implement, on a permanent basis, those components beneficial to Medicare beneficiaries and the Medicare program, unless a required evaluation of the program states that it: (1) increases expenditures under Medicare with respect to participating beneficiaries, or (2) decreases the quality of health care services furnished to such beneficiaries.</summary>
