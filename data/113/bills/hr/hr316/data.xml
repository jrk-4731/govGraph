Collinsville Renewable Energy Production Act - Authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), upon request of the town of Canton, Connecticut (Town), to: (1) reinstate the expired license for either or each of the projects numbered 10822 and 10823; (2) extend for two years after the date on which either or each such project is reinstated the time period during which the licensee must commence project construction, and (3) transfer such license to the Town upon a showing that the transfer is in the public interest.

Sets forth the conditions of such transfer, including those for the protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife and related habitat.

Directs FERC to supplement the environmental impact statement or similar analysis prepared in connection with the issuance of the original license to examine all new circumstances and information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the reinstatement or impact of the license.</summary>
