Defines \"sufficiently complete\" as competent, credible, probative, and containing such information as required to make a decision on the claim for which the report is provided.\n\nRequires the Secretary to submit: (1) a report on the progress of the VA's Acceptable Clinical Evidence initiative in reducing the necessity for in-person disability examinations, and (2) an annual report for each VA regional office regarding claims for which private medical evidence was determined to be unacceptable."
