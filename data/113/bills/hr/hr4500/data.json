Requires the head of such entity to: (1) manage and identify opportunities for integration of such ranges and facilities; and (2) assist the military departments, the National Guard, and elements of DOD to gain access to such ranges and facilities.\n\nRequires the PCA to establish and maintain a list of commonly used terms relating to cyber matters to improve the coordination and cooperation among the military departments and other federal agencies.\n\nDirects the head of the coordination entity to carry out one or more pilot programs to demonstrate commercially available, cloud-based cyber training, exercise, and test environments that are accessible to defense laboratories, the National Guard, academia, and the private sector."
