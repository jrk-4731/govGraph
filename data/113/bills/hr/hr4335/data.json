Gives estates one year after the date they received such notification to make such an application.\n\nRequires the Secretary to reimburse a successful veterans' benefits claimant for the medical costs that: (1) were charged to the claimant while the claim was pending, and (2) would have been reimbursed or provided by the VA if the treatment occurred after the claim was approved. Directs the Secretary to recommend to each claimant, when they file a claim, to retain documentation regarding such costs."
