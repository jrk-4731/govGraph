  <summary date="2014-04-28T12:44:04Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on April 1, 2014. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyr's Monument in Fort Greene Park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).

Requires the study to include: (1) an analysis of operational issues that should be considered if the Monument were to be designated as an NPS unit; (2) an analysis of the feasibility of administering the Monument, considering its size, configuration, and other factors including an annual cost estimate; (3) an analysis of the economic, educational, and other impacts of the designation of the Monument as an NPS unit; (4) an analysis of the effect of such designation on existing commercial and recreational activities, and on the authorization, construction, operation, maintenance, or improvement of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage those activities; and (5) an identification of any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-federal lands if the Monument is designated as an NPS unit.

Requires, upon commencement of the study, owners of private property in or adjacent to the Monument to be notified of the study's commencement and scope.</summary>
