Requires waiver or forgiveness of all fees and penalties related to any default or delinquency on the original mortgage.\n\nAuthorizes the FHFA Director, in his or her sole discretion, to require each enterprise to pay a servicer an appropriate fee for each qualified mortgage of an enterprise that the servicer refinances through a refinancing mortgage.\n\nProhibits any requirement of a property appraisal."
