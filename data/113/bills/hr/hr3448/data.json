Limits any EGC to a single change of minimum increment (thus prohibiting any increases in the minimum).\n\nRequires the SEC, upon notification of an EGC election, to inform each trading venue where the EGC securities are quoted or traded.\n\nRequires that securities of issuers that cease to be EGCs be quoted at the increment at which such securities would be quoted without regard to the minimum increments established under this Act.\n\nPrescribes pricing and trading procedures governing securities trading below $1.00.\n\nDirects the SEC to require an EGC under this Act to submit additional reports and disclosures.\n\nShields an issuer from liability for losses caused solely by the quoting or trading of its securities at a minimum increment of $0.05 or $0.10, another SEC-authorized increment, or by both such quoting and trading.\n\nDirects the SEC to report biannually to Congress on: (1) the quoting and trading of securities in increments permitted by this Act, and (2) the extent to which such quoting and trading increases liquidity and active trading by incentivizing capital commitment, research coverage, and brokerage support.\n\nAuthorizes the SEC to: (1) make adjustments to the pilot program to ensure that it can provide statistically meaningful or reliable results, and (2) conduct any other study or pilot program to evaluate quoting or trading in various minimum increments.\n\nSunsets the pilot program five years after enactment of this Act."
