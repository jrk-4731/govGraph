  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act - Directs the Department of Commerce to carry out a program to establish clean technology consortia to enhance U.S. economic, environmental, and energy security by promoting domestic development, manufacture, and deployment of clean technologies, production processes, or methodologies that:

 produce energy from renewable energy sources; transmit, distribute, or store energy more efficiently; enhance energy efficiency for buildings and industry; enable the development of a Smart Grid (an electric power system to maintain a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure that can meet future demand growth, including by deploying demand-side resources that enable consumers to reduce or shift their electricity usage during peak periods); produce an advanced or sustainable material with energy or energy efficiency applications; improve energy efficiency for transportation, including electric vehicles; or enhance water security through improved water management, conservation, distribution, or end use applications. Requires Commerce to award grants for the establishment and operation of consortia.

Establishes the role of consortia, including promoting new innovative clean technologies, providing technical or financial assistance, and accelerating investment in and deployment of clean technologies through public-private partnerships.</summary>
