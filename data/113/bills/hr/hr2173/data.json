Directs LEA grantees to conduct a valid and reliable full population survey of teaching and learning, at the school and LEA level, the results of which are to inform and be integrated into such systems.\n\nRequires a formal evaluation of each system to be conducted by the state, an institution of higher education, or an external agency and the results disseminated widely."
