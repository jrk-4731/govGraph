Allows such transmissions to be used only for momentary accident avoidance or anonymized traffic reporting.\n\nBars federal agencies from requiring motor vehicles to have a \"black box\" accident data recorder that records vehicle data for longer than the last five minutes of vehicle operation. Prohibits such devices from: (1) recording audio, images, or video from inside the vehicle; or (2) broadcasting or transmitting any data except by a direct cable connection to a computer."
