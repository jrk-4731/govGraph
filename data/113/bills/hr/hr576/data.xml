  <summary date="2013-02-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Save Endangered Species Act of 2013 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior to reissue the final rule published on September 2, 2005, which allows for the taking, export or re-import, delivery, receipt, carrying, and transport, shipment, or sale in interstate or foreign commerce, in the course of a commercial activity, of U.S. captive-bred live scimitar-horned oryx, addax, or dama gazelle, including embryos, gametes, and sport-hunted trophies, as long as certain criteria are met, including that the purpose of such activity is associated with the management or transfer of live wildlife or sport hunting in a manner that contributes to increasing or sustaining captive numbers or to potential reintroduction to range countries.

Directs the Secretary to reissue such rule without regard to any other statute or regulation that applies to issuance of such rule. Exempts such reissuance from judicial review.</summary>
