Disregards, in computing adjusted gross income in that formula, any amounts transferred from a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) to a Roth IRA.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize the use of tax return information involving such amounts for disclosure to carry out those subsidy adjustments.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with the Commissioner of Social Security, to refund to an individual the portion of premiums paid under Medicare parts B and D equal to the difference between the premiums paid and the premiums the individual would have paid if any rollovers to a Roth IRA from an eligible non-Roth IRA retirement plan made on or after January 1, 2011, had not been taken into account."
