Sets forth an exception for companies that include in their annual report a certification of their participation in good standing with the Global Network Initiative or other specified multi-stakeholder initiatives.\n\nAmends the Export Administration Act of 1979, as continued in effect under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to direct the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) establish a list of goods and technology that would assist a foreign government in acquiring the capability to carry out censorship, surveillance, or any other related activity through means of telecommunications, including the Internet; and (2) prohibit the export of listed goods or technology to a government end-user (including a wholly or partially government-owned telecommunications or Internet service provider) in any Internet-restricting country."
