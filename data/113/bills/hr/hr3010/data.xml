  <summary date="2013-08-02T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Keep Repos to Maturity on Balance Sheet Act of 2013 - Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in establishing accounting principles or standards for purposes of the securities laws, to require that a repurchase-to-maturity transaction be treated as a secured borrowing in which the transferred asset serves as collateral.

 Defines "repurchase-to-maturity transaction" as one in which: (1) a financial asset is transferred in exchange for cash, other financial assets, or letters of credit; and (2) concurrently the transferor and the transferee agree that, at the asset's maturity, the transferee may either return the transferred asset (or a substantially similar asset) to the transferor, or redeem the transferred asset from the issuer of the transferred asset.</summary>
