Requires the finalized plan to be presented to the House and Senate small business committees by not later than 90 days prior to implementation.\n\nDirects the Administrator to: (1) implement the plan by the first day of FY2017, and (2) annually provide to such committees certification of the accuracy and completeness of data reported on bundled and consolidated contracts.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General (GAO): (1) to initiate a study by the first day of FY2018 on the effectiveness of the plan that shall assess whether contracts were accurately labeled as bundled or consolidated; and (2) not later than 12 months after initiating the study, to report to the small business committees on the results from such study and, if warranted, any recommendations on how to improve the quality of data reported on bundled and consolidated contracts."
