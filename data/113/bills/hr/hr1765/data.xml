Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), notwithstanding the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), any other provision of law, or sequestration order, to transfer for FY2013 to any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) appropriations accounts (such as the one for air traffic control operations) a certain amount from funds otherwise made available for discretionary grants-in-aid under the airport improvement program or any other FAA program.

Makes any transferred amount available immediately for obligation and expenditure as directly appropriated budget authority.

Prohibits any such transfer of funds unless the Secretary notifies Congress at least five days in advance.</summary>
