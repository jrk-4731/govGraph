(Under current law, such a director may only appoint through such period a candidate already possessing a bachelor's degree or a qualified veteran.)\n\nDirects the Secretary to report to the congressional defense committees on the implementation and use by DOD of specified hiring authorities provided under federal law, prior defense authorization Acts, and the Intergovernmental Personnel Act.\n\nAmends the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 to reinstate and make permanent a DOD personnel program for the hiring of scientific and technical personnel."
