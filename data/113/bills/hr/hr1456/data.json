Considers such standards to be a consumer product safety rule issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).\n\nRequires ASTM International to notify CPSC of any proposed revision to applicable standards. Requires the proposed revision to be incorporated in the consumer product safety rule unless CPSC notifies ASTM International that such revision does not carry out the purposes of this Act."
