Exempts a land conveyance from withdrawal if carried out under the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act or the Santini-Burton Act.\n\nRequires the Chair of the Lake Tahoe Federal Interagency Partnership to submit to Congress a prioritized list of all Environmental Improvement Program projects for the Basin. Authorizes the Secretary, the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to carry out or provide financial assistance to specified projects and projects included in the prioritized list that have been subject to environmental review and approval under federal and state law and the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact.\n\nRequires the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to deploy strategies consistent with the Lake Tahoe Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan to prevent the introduction of aquatic invasive species into the Lake Tahoe Basin.\n\nRequires the Secretary, the Administrator, the Agency, California, Nevada, and the Tahoe Science Consortium to implement a Lake Tahoe Basin Program that includes: (1) developing and updating an integrated multiagency programmatic assessment and monitoring plan and evaluating the effectiveness of the Agency's Environmental Improvement Program, and (2) providing support to governments in reducing pollutants that contribute to the loss of lake clarity.\n\nProhibits: (1) the importation of the quagga mussel of the species Dreissena rostriformis into the United States, a U.S. territory, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or any U.S. possession; and (2) the shipment of the mussel between the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession. Requires the prohibited mussels to be exported or destroyed at the expense of the importer or consignee.\n\nProvides that nothing in this Act applies to: (1) the importation or transportation of prohibited species through the operation of a public water system or a related water conveyance, storage, or distribution facility; or (2) the possession or conveyance of water supplies containing prohibited species by a public water system operator."
