    "text": "The Residential Energy and Economic Savings Act or the TREES Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (DOE)\u00a0to: (1) establish a grant program to provide financial, technical, and related assistance to retail power providers to support the establishment of new, or continued operation of existing, targeted residential tree-planting programs; and (2) create a national public recognition initiative to encourage such providers to participate in such programs.\n\nSets forth requirements that must be met for tree-planting programs to qualify for assistance, including a requirement to provide free or discounted shade-providing or wind-reducing trees to residential consumers interested in lowering their home energy costs. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants only to providers that have entered into binding legal agreements with nonprofit tree-planting organizations.\n\nRequires a provider, in order to qualify for assistance, to consult with such organization and state foresters to establish a local technical advisory committee, which shall provide advice and consultation to the program. Authorizes the advisory committee to: (1) design and adopt an approved plant list that emphasizes the use of hardy, noninvasive tree species, native or low water-use shade trees, or both; (2) design and adopt planting, installation, and maintenance specifications and create a process for inspection and quality control; (3) ensure that tree recipients are educated to care for and maintain their trees over the long term; (4) help the public become more engaged and educated in the planting and care of shade trees; (5) prioritize which sites receive trees, giving preference to locations with the most potential for energy conservation and secondary preference to areas where the average annual income is below the regional median; and (6) assist with monitoring and collection of data on tree health, tree survival, and energy conservation benefits generated under this Act."
