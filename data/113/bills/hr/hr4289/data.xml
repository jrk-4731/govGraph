  <summary date="2014-07-08T17:27:41Z" status="Passed House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act or the DHS Interoperable Communications Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include among the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Management responsibilities with respect to policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among the components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Requires such Under Secretary to submit to the House and Senate homeland security committees a strategy, which shall be updated as necessary, for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, including for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies, with corresponding milestones, that includes:

 an assessment of interoperability gaps in radio communications among the DHS components, as of this Act's enactment date; information on DHS efforts and activities, including current and planned policies, directives, and training, since November 1, 2012, to achieve and maintain interoperable communications, and planned efforts and activities to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; an assessment of obstacles and challenges to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications; information on, and an assessment of, the adequacy of mechanisms available to the Under Secretary to enforce and compel compliance with interoperable communications policies and directives of DHS; guidance provided to DHS components to implement interoperable communications policies and directives; the total amount of funds expended by DHS since November 1, 2012, and projected future expenditures, to achieve interoperable communications; and dates upon which DHS-wide interoperability is projected to be achieved for voice, data, and video communications, respectively, and interim milestones. Directs the Under Secretary to submit information on any intra-agency effort or task force that has been delegated responsibilities by the Under Secretary relating to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications within a specified time frame, and on who, within each component, is responsible for implementing policies and directives issued by the Under Secretary to achieve and maintain interoperable communications.

Directs the Under Secretary to report on the status of efforts since the issuance of the strategy to implement such strategy, including: (1) progress on each interim milestone; (2) information on any policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary; (3) an assessment of the level of compliance, adoption, and participation among the DHS components with the policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary; and (4) information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary.</summary>
