Authorizes NOAA to renew a declaration.\n\nEstablishes the Marine Disease Emergency Working Group in NOAA to provide advice on assessing, declaring, and responding to those emergencies.\n\nEstablishes the Marine Disease Emergency Fund for responding to those emergencies.\n\nRequires NOAA to establish a National Data Repository for Marine Diseases Research and Services to collect, store, and disseminate information on marine diseases and related data and facilitate the development and rapid dissemination of research on marine diseases.\n\nDeems sea star wasting syndrome, a marine mortality event affecting species of sea stars, to be a marine disease emergency."
