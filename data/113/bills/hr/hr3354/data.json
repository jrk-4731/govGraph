    "text": "Dry Cask Storage Act - Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish a procedure to require the designation of spent nuclear fuel contained in storage pools as qualified to be placed in dry cask storage when the fuel has cooled sufficiently to permit it.\n\nRequires all spent nuclear fuel that is contained in storage pools and qualified to be placed in dry cask storage to be moved, within 15 years of enactment of this Act, to dry casks certified by the NRC.\n\nRequires the fuel, within one year after being designated as qualified to be placed in dry cask storage, to be moved from storage pools and placed in certified dry casks. Requires such casks, to the extent appropriate after a cost-benefit analysis, to be stored temporarily in hardened onsite storage facilities.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to determine compliance costs for the owner of the spent nuclear fuel, and to reduce by that amount the amount due from the owner to the Nuclear Waste Fund pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982."
