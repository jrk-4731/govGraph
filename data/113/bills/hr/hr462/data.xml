Utah National Guard Readiness Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to convey to the state of Utah, without consideration, certain lands located within the boundaries of the public lands currently withdrawn for military use by the Utah National Guard and known as "Camp Williams" for the purpose of permitting the Utah National Guard to use such conveyed land.

Supersedes a specified Executive Order insofar as it affects the lands identified for conveyance.

Reverts conveyed lands to the United States if the Secretary of Defense (DOD) determines that the land, or any part of such land, is sold or attempted to be sold, or that the land or any part of it is used for non-National Guard or non-national defense purposes.

Requires the state, with respect to any part of the land conveyed that the Secretary of Defense determines is subject to reversion and which the Secretary determines contains hazardous materials, to pay the United States the fair market value of that part of the conveyed land. Bars the application of the reversionary interest to that part of the land.</summary>
