Lists activities that may be supported by such grants, including for: (1) the development of teaching materials and methods, (2) faculty professional development, (3) centers to provide models and leadership, (4) activities to enhance student recruitment and retention, and (5) partnerships to ensure the development of an advanced manufacturing workforce with skills necessary to meet regional economic needs."
