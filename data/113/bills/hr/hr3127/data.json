    "text": "Cutting Red Tape, Green-Lighting Small Businesses Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an employer with not less than 2 or more than 150 employees in a calendar year a business-related tax credit for the cost of up to 5 newly-hired employees who are employed, on average, at least 30 hours per week. Makes such credit available to tax-exempt eligible small employers. Terminates such credit for wages paid after December 31, 2015.\n\nAmends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) determine, for a new small business concern, what SBA applications, submissions, or other paperwork are not essential to file during the first year of operation of such small business concern; and (2) make rules for the waiver of such filings."
