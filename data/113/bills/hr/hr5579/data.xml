  <summary date="2014-09-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Leveraging and Energizing America's Apprenticeship Programs Act or the LEAP Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit of $1,500 for hiring&#160;an apprenticeship employee who has not attained age 25&#160;at the close of the taxable year or $1,000 for an apprenticeship employee who has attained age 25. Allows such credit for no more than&#160;two taxable years with respect to any apprenticeship employee. Defines "apprenticeship employee" as an employee who is employed in an officially-recognized apprenticeable occupation pursuant to an apprentice agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency.

Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to coordinate with the heads of federal agencies to: (1) determine which government publications could be available on government websites and no longer printed, (2) devise a strategy to reduce overall government printing costs over the 10-year period beginning with FY2015, (3) establish government-wide guidelines on employee printing, and (4) issue guidelines for publicly disclosing information about the publication of government documents.</summary>
