  <summary date="2014-09-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) to allow expedited review of an application for the registration of a pesticide or an amendment to a currently registered pesticide if use of the pesticide proposed is reasonably expected to improve the health of managed pollinator bees (bees raised and housed in a managed hive or other appropriate housing and used for honey production, managed pollination of crops, or breeding for commercial purposes), including by managing resistance to parasitic pests of managed pollinator bees.

Requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to report on the extent and scope of the threat to the health of managed pollinator bees from: (1) pathological factors, including the species of parasitic mite known as Varroa mite (Varroa destructor), other arthropod pests, and fungal, microbial, and viral diseases; and (2) environmental factors, including the habitat, forage, beekeeper practices and husbandry, and nutritional needs of managed pollinator bees.

Requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to report on: (1) the availability of pesticides for management of parasitic pests that adversely impact the health of managed pollinator bees; and (2) EPA efforts to expedite approvals of new products to control parasitic pests of managed pollinator bees, including products to mitigate resistance to available products.</summary>
