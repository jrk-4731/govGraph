  <summary date="2014-03-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">National Design Services Act of 2014 - Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a loan repayment program for eligible architects who provide certain design services on behalf of a Community Design Center (a non-profit organization operated and managed by a licensed architect that conducts research and provides design services for community development projects).

Requires an eligible architect, in order to participate in the loan repayment program, to enter into a written contract with the Secretary that contains:

 an agreement under which: (1) the architect agrees to provide eligible design services on behalf of a Community Design Center for at least one year, and (2) the Secretary agrees to pay the principal and interest of the architect's qualifying educational loans for the period of time the architect provides such services; a provision that any U.S. financial obligation arising out of the contract, and any obligation of the architect, is contingent upon appropriations for the loan repayment program; and a statement of the damages to which the United States is entitled if the eligible architect breaches the contract.</summary>
