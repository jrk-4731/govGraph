  <summary date="2013-11-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Allows an income tax credit to employers for shutdown payments to employees who provide services under a federal contract in a federal building used for official purposes by any office or entity over which the House Committee on Administration had jurisdiction during the 113th Congress.

Defines "shutdown payments" as any payment made to an individual for wages the individual would have received if the individual were performing services for the employer under such contract during the period of October 1, 2013, through October 16, 2013, when the federal government was closed due to a lapse in appropriations.</summary>
