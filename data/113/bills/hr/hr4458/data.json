(Currently the withdrawal and reservation of such land shall terminate on March 31, 2039.)\n\nWithdraws from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws, the mineral leasing laws, and the geothermal leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights, the public land (including interests in land) known as the Cuddeback Lake Air Force Range and additional public land in San Bernardino County, California, identified as the Proposed Navy Acquisition Area (but excluding the parcel identified as \"AF Fee Simple\").
