The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nStandard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2014 - Amends the Clayton Act with respect to actions brought by the Attorney General for violations of antitrust laws. Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but only under the Clayton Act, to exercise the same authority and procedures of the Attorney General specified in the Act with respect to the prohibition against acquisition by one corporation of the stock of another (merger) that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n\nAmends the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) to exclude proposed mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, or similar transactions from FTC proceedings.\n\nGrants jurisdiction to the U.S. district courts to issue writs of mandamus commanding compliance with the FTCA or any FTC order, if the FTC applies to such courts with respect to any activity related to consummation of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or similar transaction that results in an unfair method of competition."
