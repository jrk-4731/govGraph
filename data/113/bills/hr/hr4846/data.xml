  <summary date="2014-11-13T14:37:25Z" status="Passed House amended">Arapaho National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 2014 - Adjusts the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado to incorporate approximately 92.95 acres of land generally depicted as The Wedge. Requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to include all federal land within the boundary in the Bowen Gulch Protection Area established under the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993.

Authorizes USDA to acquire non-federal lands within the boundary only by donation or exchange.

 Declares that nothing in this Act opens privately owned lands within the boundary to public motorized use. Allows motorized access for the owners of any non-federal lands within the boundary who historically have accessed their lands through the boundary lands.</summary>
