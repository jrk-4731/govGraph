  <summary date="2013-05-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Student-to-School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make matching demonstration grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) in which the student-to-school nurse ratio in each of their public elementary and secondary schools is 750 or more students to every school nurse for the purpose of reducing such ratio.

Gives grant priority to LEAs: (1) for which not fewer than 10,000 or not less than 20% of the children served are from families with incomes below the poverty line, and (2) that demonstrate the greatest need for new or additional nursing services for their students.</summary>
