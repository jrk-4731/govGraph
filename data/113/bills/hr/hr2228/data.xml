  <summary date="2013-06-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Assessment Accuracy and Improvement Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow states to require the use of adaptive assessments of student progress toward state academic performance standards that accurately assess student achievement above and below grade level while also measuring grade-level performance.

Defines an "adaptive assessment" as one that changes in difficulty in accordance with a student's performance but reports its outcome on a scale common to all students.</summary>
