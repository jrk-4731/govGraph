  <summary date="2014-02-05T16:10:33Z" status="Reported to House without amendment, Part I">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

(Sec. 1) Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to: (1) enter into cooperative agreements supporting dialogue and planning involving international partnerships between the Department of Energy (DOE), including DOE National Laboratories, and the government of Israel and its ministries, offices, and institutions; and (2) establish a joint United States-Israel Center based in an area of the United States with offshore energy development expertise to develop academic cooperation in energy innovation technology and engineering, water science, technology transfer, and analysis of geopolitical implications of new natural resource development.

Extends the grant program to support U.S.-Israel research, development, and commercialization of renewable energy or energy efficiency (as well as the related advisory committee) through September 30, 2024.

Expands the scope of covered program energy to include natural gas energy, water desalination improvement, and other water treatment technologies.

(Sec. 2) Expresses the sense of Congress that open dialogue and continued mechanisms for regular engagement encourages further U.S.-Israel public, academic, and private cooperation on energy security issues.

Directs the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of State to seek to establish an Energy Cooperation Working Group within the semi-annual United States-Israel Strategic Dialogue.

States that the Group's purpose shall be to strengthen U.S.-Israel dialogue on: (1) advancing research, development, and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency; (2) identifying policy priorities associated with Israel's natural resources development; (3) identifying best practices for energy infrastructure cybersecurity; (4) leveraging natural gas resources to impact regional stability positively; (5) developing technical and environmental management of deep-water exploration and production; and (6) implementing coastal protection and restoration.</summary>
