  <summary date="2014-07-31T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Employee Pension Fairness Act - Repeals provisions requiring federal employees, including foreign service employees,&#160;who began service after 2012&#160;to pay an increased contribution (4.4%)&#160;for funding their annuities under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) treat certain foreign corporations managed and controlled primarily in the United States as domestic corporations for U.S. tax purposes; and (2)&#160;revise rules for the taxation of inverted corporations (i.e., U.S. corporations that acquire foreign companies to reincorporate in a foreign jurisdiction with lower income tax rates than the United States).</summary>
