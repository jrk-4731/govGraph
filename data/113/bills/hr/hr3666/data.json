Title III: Other Measures to Combat Tax Haven Abuses - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to: (1) require corporations registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report annually, on a country-by country basis, on employees, gross revenues, payments made to governments, and other financial information; and (2) impose a fine for failure to disclose any holdings or transactions involving equity or debt instruments known to involve a foreign entity that would otherwise be subject to disclosure requirements.\n\nMakes investment advisers and persons engaged in forming new business entities subject to anti-money laundering requirements.\n\nTitle IV Ending Corporate Offshore Tax Avoidance - Imposes new restrictions on U.S. corporations and other entities with foreign income with respect to: (1) tax deductions allocable to deferred foreign income, (2) the recalculation of foreign income taxes, (3) intangible property transferred overseas, (4) tax evasion activities by U.S. corporations reincorporating in a foreign country, and (5) loans to U.S. shareholders from controlled foreign corporations."
