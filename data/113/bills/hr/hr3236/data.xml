Makes such reduction applicable to days occurring after the date of the general election for federal office held in November 2014.

Requires any amount of pay of a Member of Congress in the 113th Congress that is reduced due to a government shutdown to be held in escrow until the last day of the 113th Congress and released for payment to Members at that time.</summary>
