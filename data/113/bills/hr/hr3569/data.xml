  <summary date="2013-11-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Protecting the Freedoms and Benefits for All Veterans Act - Revises the definition of "surviving spouse" for purposes of veterans benefits provisions to eliminate the requirement that the person who was the spouse of a veteran at the time of the veteran's death be a person of the opposite sex.

Considers an individual to be a "spouse" if: (1) the marriage is valid in the state in which it was entered into; or (2) in the case of a marriage entered into outside any state, the marriage is valid in the place in which it was entered into and could have been entered into in a state, or it was valid in the place in which all parties to it resided at the time it was entered into.</summary>
