The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nFlushing Remonstrance Study Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the John Bowne House in Queens, New York, the Friends Meeting House at 137-17 Northern Boulevard, Queens, and other resources in the vicinity of Flushing related to the history of religious freedom during the era of the 1657 signing of the Flushing Remonstrance (the study area).\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) evaluate the national significance of the study area's resources; (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of designating resources within the study area as a unit of the National Park System (NPS); (3) identify properties related to the John Bowne House that could potentially meet criteria for designation as a National Historic Landmark; (4) evaluate the impact of the proposed action on the flow of commerce and commercial activity, job opportunities, and any adverse economic effects that could not be avoided if the proposal is implemented; (5) analyze the effect of the designation of the study area as an NPS unit on existing recreational activities, and on the authorization, construction, operation, maintenance, or improvement of energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage those activities; and (6) identify any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on non-federal lands if the study area is designated as an NPS unit.\n\nRequires the owners of private property in or adjacent to the study area to be notified of such study's commencement and scope."
