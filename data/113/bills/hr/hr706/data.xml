  <summary date="2014-12-22T13:22:02Z" status="Reported to House with amendment(s)">Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park Establishment Act - (Sec. 3) Establishes the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park in Massachusetts and Rhode Island as a unit of the National Park System.

Requires the Secretary to prepare a general management plan for the Park that considers ways to use preexisting or planned visitor facilities and recreational opportunities developed in the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.

Dedicates the Park to former Senator John H. Chafee from Rhode Island in recognition of: (1) his role in the preservation of the resources of the Blackstone River Valley and the heritage corridor that bears his name, and (2) his decades of service to the people of Rhode Island and the United States.

Requires a memorial to be displayed at a location in the Park that recognizes Senator Chafee's role in the preservation of the resources of the Blackstone River Valley for the people of the United States.

Prohibits the use of condemnation to acquire land or interests in land under this Act. Prohibits anything in this Act from: (1) creating buffer zones outside the Park; or (2) restricting an activity because it can be seen, heard, or detected within the Park from being conducted outside its boundaries.</summary>
