  <summary date="2013-07-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2013 - Prohibits a state, for each fiscal year beginning three years after enactment of this Act, from having in effect a law or policy that: (1) allows a person to use deadly force when such person is threatened and that does not impose a duty to retreat before using such force in any place where that person is lawfully present (commonly known as a "stand your ground law"), except where the person is a victim of domestic violence; or (2) allows the establishment, organization, or operation of, or participation in, a Neighborhood Watch program that is not registered with the local law enforcement agency and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Allows the Attorney General to authorize up to two one-year extensions of such deadline.

Provides that a state that fails to substantially implement this Act for any fiscal year shall not receive 20% of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to it under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program. Provides for alternative procedures for compliance by a state that is unable to substantially implement this Act because of a conflict with the state's constitution.

Directs the Attorney General to conduct a study of state stand your ground laws, including by examining: (1) the effect that such laws have on rates of violent deaths, and (2) whether women and minorities are targets of the force authorized by such laws at a higher rate than the general population.</summary>
