(Small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans and small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities must be in that database to participate in the Veterans First program that gives VA contracting preferences to those businesses.)\n\nRequires the Administrator to employ database fraud prevention measures that include: (1) the investigation of allegations of potential fraud, (2) the removal of unqualified businesses from the database, and (3) the referral of cases for prosecution when appropriate.\n\nRequires any appeal by a small business of any determination of its status as a veteran-owned business to be heard by the SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals.\n\nDirects the Secretary, for the six years beginning on a date agreed to in the memorandum, to use fees the Secretary collects under multiple-award schedule contracts to reimburse the Administrator for the costs the Administrator incurs in implementing the memorandum.\n\nRequires the Secretary and the Administrator, every 180 days, to: (1) meet to discuss ways to improve collaboration under the memorandum to increase opportunities for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and veteran-owned small businesses, (2) consult with congressionally-chartered Veterans Service Organizations to discuss ways to increase opportunities for those businesses, and (3) report to Congress on their progress in implementing the memorandum.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the SBA specifying the manner in which the Secretary shall notify the Administrator as to whether an individual is a veteran and if that veteran has a service-connected disability."
