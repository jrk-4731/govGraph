    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House as amended, Part I, on June 10, 2013. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nSwap Jurisdiction Certainty Act - Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to issue jointly rules governing the application of swaps requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commodity Exchange Act, relating to cross-border swaps and security-based swaps transactions involving U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons.\n\nRequires such rules to be identical (except to the extent necessary to accommodate differences in other underlying statutory requirements), and to address: (1) the nature of the connections to the United States that require a non-U.S. person to register as a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or security-based swap participant under each Commission's respective Acts and related regulations; (2) the extent to which U.S. swaps requirements shall apply to the swap and security-based swap activities of non-U.S. persons, U.S. persons, and their branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and affiliates outside the United States; and (3) the circumstances under which a non-U.S. person in compliance with the regulatory requirements of a foreign jurisdiction shall be exempt from U.S. swaps requirements.\n\nDirects the Commissions to exempt from U.S. swaps requirements any non-U.S. person in compliance with the swaps regulatory requirements of a country or administrative region having one of the nine largest combined swap and security-based swap markets by notional amount in the calendar year preceding issuance of such rules (unless the Commissions jointly determine that such requirements are not broadly equivalent to U.S. swaps requirements).\n\nRequires the Commissions to report to Congress if they determine jointly that the regulatory requirements of such foreign jurisdictions are not broadly equivalent to U.S. swaps requirements."
