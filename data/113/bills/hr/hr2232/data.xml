  <summary date="2013-06-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Make Every Small Business Count Act of 2013 - Amends the Small Business Act provisions relating to federal agency contracting and subcontracting goals with respect to small businesses to allow prime contractors under a subcontracting plan pertaining to a single contract to receive credit under such goals for using small businesses as first tier subcontractors or at any tier under such plan.

Allows the prime contractor, if the subcontracting goals pertain to more than one contract with one or more federal agencies or to one contract with more than one federal agency, to count only first tier subcontractors that are small businesses.

Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to submit to the congressional small business committees a report studying the feasibility of using federal subcontracting reporting systems to attribute subcontractors to particular contracts in the case of contractors that have subcontracting plans that pertain to multiple contracts with federal agencies.</summary>
