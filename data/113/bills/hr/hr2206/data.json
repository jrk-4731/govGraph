    "text": "No Tolerance Act - Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to establish and maintain a policy to uniformly define and prescribe what constitutes an inappropriate and prohibited relationship, communication, conduct, or contact, including when such an action is consensual, between: (1) a member of the Armed Forces (member) who is superior in rank to, exercises control over, or supervises a person during entry-level process or training; and (2) a prospective member or member undergoing such processing and training. Makes violators subject to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).\n\nDirects such Secretaries to require the processing for administrative separation of any member in response to the first substantiated violation of such policy, if the member is not otherwise punitively discharged or dismissed for such violation.\n\nRequires the DOD Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees a proposed UCMJ punitive article regarding such violations."
