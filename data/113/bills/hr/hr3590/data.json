(Abolishes the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council.) Title VIII: Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act - Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act - (Sec. 802) Declares that recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be provided on public lands and waters without adverse effects on other uses or users.\n\n(Sec. 804) Requires a federal public land management official, in cooperation with the respective state and fish and wildlife agency, to exercise the authority of the official under law, including regarding land use planning, to facilitate the use of, and access to, federal public land for fishing, sport hunting, and recreational shooting, except as described in this Act.\n\nRequires the heads of federal public land management agencies to exercise their discretion in a manner that supports and facilitates hunting, recreational fishing, and recreational shooting opportunities, to the extent authorized under applicable law.\n\nProhibits actions taken under this Act or actions concerning the National Wildlife Refuge System under the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 from being considered to be a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\n\nProhibits public land management officials from being required to consider the existence or availability of recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting opportunities on adjacent or nearby lands in the planning for or determination of which public lands are open for these activities or in the setting of levels of use for these activities on public lands, unless the combination or coordination of such opportunities would enhance the opportunities available to the public.\n\nRequires that Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service land, excluding land on the Outer Continental Shelf, be open to recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting unless the managing agency acts to close lands to such activity. Permits closures or restrictions on such land for purposes including resource conservation, public safety, energy or mineral production, energy generation or transmission infrastructure, water supply facilities, national security, protection of private property rights, or compliance with other law.\n\nRequires agencies to: (1) lease or permit use of federal public land for shooting ranges, and (2) designate specific land for recreational shooting activities. Declares that the provision of opportunities for hunting, fishing, recreational shooting, and the conservation of fish and wildlife to provide sustainable use recreational opportunities on designated wilderness areas on federal public lands constitutes the measures necessary to meet the minimum requirements for the administration of such areas. Provides that such declaration does not authorize or facilitate commodity development, use, or extraction, motorized recreational access or use that is not otherwise allowed under the Wilderness Act, or permanent road construction or maintenance within designated wilderness areas.\n\nReaffirms the provisions of the Wilderness Act that stipulate that wilderness purposes are \"within and supplemental to\" the purposes of the underlying federal land unit. Requires the head of each federal agency, when seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation programs and projects or providing fish and wildlife dependent recreation opportunities on designated wilderness areas, to implement these supplemental purposes while not impeding on the underlying conservation purpose. Prohibits such implementation from authorizing or facilitating commodity development, use or extraction, motorized recreational access, road construction or maintenance, or use not otherwise allowed within designated wilderness areas.\n\nRequires biennial reports on closures of federal public lands to sport hunting, recreational fishing, or shooting. Sets forth requirements for specified closures or significant restrictions involving 640 or more contiguous acres of federal public land or water to hunting or recreational fishing or related activities.\n\nInstructs federal public land agencies to consult with the advisory councils specified in Executive Orders 12962 (relating to recreational fisheries) and 13443 (relating to the facilitation of hunting heritage and wildlife conservation) in carrying out this Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary to manage the Ozark National Scenic Riverways to allow the use of motorized vessels in a manner not more restrictive than the use restrictions in effect on November 21, 2013. Permits the Secretary to manage the area to allow the use of motorized vessels in a manner that is less restrictive than such use restrictions.\n\n(Sec. 805) Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from restricting the use of dogs in deer hunting activities within the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana unless those restrictions are applicable to the smallest practicable parts and are necessary for the reduction or control of trespassing onto adjacent land.\n\nTitle IX: Respect for Treaties and Rights - (Sec. 901) Prohibits this Act from being construed to affect or modify any treaty or other right of any federally recognized Indian tribe.\n\nTitle X: Exemptions for Taking Migratory Birds on Certain Agricultural Land - Hunter and Farmer Protection Act - (Sec. 1002) Amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to permit the taking of any migratory game bird, including waterfowl, coots, and cranes, on or over land that: (1) is not otherwise a baited area; and (2) contains a standing crop (including an aquatic crop), standing, flooded, or manipulated natural vegetation, flooded harvested cropland, or an area on which seed or grain has been scattered solely as the result of a normal agricultural practice, as determined by the head of the state office of the USDA Cooperative Extension System with the concurrence of the state department of fish and wildlife.\n\nTitle XI: Sense of Congress Regarding Snowmobiles on National Forest System Lands - (Sec. 1101) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Forest Service should continue to allow snowmobiles access to National Forest System lands at the same levels allowed as of March 28, 2013, subject to closures for public health and safety at the discretion of the respective agencies, until a final travel management rule is promulgated for snowmobiles."
