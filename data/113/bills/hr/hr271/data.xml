  <summary date="2013-05-20T16:12:35Z" status="Reported to House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Resolving Environmental and Grid Reliability Conflicts Act of 2013 - Amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to ensure that any emergency order issued under such Act for the interconnection of facilities for the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy, that may result in a conflict with a requirement of any environmental law, shall: (1) require generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy only during hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest; and (2) to the maximum extent practical, be consistent with any other applicable environmental law and minimize any adverse environmental impacts.

Provides that any omission or action taken by a party to comply with such an order that results in noncompliance with any environmental law shall not: (1) be considered a violation of such law; or (2) subject such party to any requirement of, or any civil or criminal liability under, such law.

Requires such an order that may result in a conflict with environmental law to expire within 90 days after it is issued. Authorizes FERC to renew or reissue such order for subsequent periods, not to exceed 90 days each, as necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.

Requires FERC, in renewing or reissuing such order, to: (1) consult with the primary federal agency with expertise in the environmental interest protected by such law and include in any such order conditions determined to be necessary to minimize any adverse environmental impacts, and (2) make such conditions available to the public. Authorizes FERC to exclude such a condition from the order if such condition would prevent the order from adequately addressing the emergency.

Authorizes, during an emergency, a municipality engaged in the transmission or sale of electric energy and not otherwise subject to FERC's jurisdiction to make temporary connections with public utilities subject to FERC's jurisdiction and construct temporary facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce as may be necessary or appropriate to meet such emergency.</summary>
