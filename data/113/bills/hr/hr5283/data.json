Authorizes regulations requiring manufacturers to use recovered materials in the product or packaging.\n\nDirects the EPA and the Department of Commerce to develop a voluntary system of packaging standards with respect to materials contained within the packaging and the recyclability of the packaging upon discard. Requires the standard to provide that packaging that meets the standards be eligible to use a label indicating compliance for promotional and educational purposes."
