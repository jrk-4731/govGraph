Prohibits an entity from: (1) receiving a loan guarantee if it was responsible for contaminating the brownfield to be redeveloped, or (2) having more than one outstanding loan that is guaranteed under the Program.\n\nSets forth requirements regarding an eligible loan's principal amount, interest rate, duration, and repayment terms. Directs the Secretary to establish criteria for selecting entities to receive loan guarantees."
