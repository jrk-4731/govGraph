Requires the fellowship program to offer fellows: (1) the academic courses they need to earn a master's degree if they lack one, (2) the academic courses and leadership training they need to become master teachers in elementary and secondary schools if they already have a master's degree in education or their respective field, and (3) additional training programs that enable them to fulfill their service requirements.\n\nAmends parts A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) and B (Mathematics and Science Partnerships) of title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to reauthorize appropriations under those parts for FY2014-FY2019.\n\nProhibits any single participant in a part A partnership (between IHEs and high-need LEAs) under part A from using more than 75% (currently 50%) of the partnership grant."
