  <summary date="2014-11-17T20:36:47Z" status="Passed House amended">Ashland Breakwater Light Transfer Act - Adjusts the boundary of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin to include the Ashland Harbor Breakwater Light Addition at the end of the breakwater on Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin.

Declares that Congress does not intend for the designation of that property to create a protective perimeter or buffer zone around its boundary. Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to operate, maintain, keep, locate, inspect, repair, and replace any federal aid to navigation located at the Ashland Harbor Breakwater Light for as long as it is needed for navigational purposes.

Permits the Secretary to enter, at any time, the Ashland Harbor Breakwater Light or any federal aid to navigation at the Breakwater Light, for as long as such aid is needed for navigational purposes, without notice to the extent that it is not possible to provide advance notice.

Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with the city of Ashland and the County of Bayfield, Wisconsin, for the purpose of cooperative law enforcement and emergency services within the boundaries of the Lakeshore.</summary>
