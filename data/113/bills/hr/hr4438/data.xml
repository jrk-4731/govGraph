      <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Kirkpatrick motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to ensure that businesses can only claim the Research and Development credit for expenses attributable to wages if they: (1) guarantee female employees receive equal pay for equal work; (2) give priority to hiring unemployed Americans, especially veterans; and (3) do not outsource American jobs. Additionally, the motion ensures that the underlying legislation cannot take effect if it increases the deficit.</text>
