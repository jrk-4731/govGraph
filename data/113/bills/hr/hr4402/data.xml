  <summary date="2014-12-08T19:23:32Z" status="Reported to House amended, Part I">Guam Military Training and Readiness Act of 2014 - Authorizes the Secretaries of the Navy and the Interior to enter into an agreement providing for the establishment and operation of a surface danger zone that overlays the Ritidian Unit of the Guam National Wildlife Refuge in order to accommodate the operation of a live-fire training range complex on Andersen Air Force Base-Northwest Field and the management of such Unit.

Requires such agreement to include measures to maintain the purposes of the Refuge and measures funded by the Secretary of the Navy for:

 relocation and reconstruction of Refuge structures and facilities; mitigation of impacts to wildlife species present in, or to be reintroduced into, the Refuge; use of Department of Defense (DOD) personnel to undertake conservation activities within the Unit normally performed by Department of the Interior personnel; and necessary openings and closures of the surface danger zone to the public.</summary>
