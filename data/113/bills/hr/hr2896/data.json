Excludes from the meaning of \"administrative costs\" costs for investigating and identifying the extent of the contamination, designing and performing a response action, or monitoring a natural resource.\n\nRequires the Administrator to give priority to small communities, Indian tribes, rural areas, or low-income areas with a population of not more than 15,000 in providing assistance to facilitate the inventory of brownfield sites, site assessments, remediation of brownfield sites, community involvement, or site preparation.\n\nRequires the Administrator, in giving grants for brownfields revitalization, to give consideration to waterfront brownfield sites.\n\nRequires the Administrator to establish a program to provide grants to: (1) carry out inventory, characterization, assessment, planning, feasibility analysis, design, or remediation activities to locate a clean energy project at brownfield sites; and (2) capitalize a revolving loan fund for such purposes.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to provide grants for state response programs.\n\nExtends the authorizations of appropriations for brownfields revitalization funding and state response programs."
