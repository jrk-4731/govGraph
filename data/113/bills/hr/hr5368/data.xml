 Directs the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to: (1) coordinate with the heads of federal agencies and the governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to promote public policies which prioritize growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable alternatives to emigration; and (2) incorporate such programming with assistance to communities and economic sectors in such countries.

Amends the the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to remove pilot program status from (and so make permanent) the program to repatriate unaccompanied alien children.
