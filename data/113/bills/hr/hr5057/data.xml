  <summary date="2014-12-19T04:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on September 11, 2014. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

EPS Service Parts Act of 2014 - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exempt external power supplies (EPS) for four years from energy conservation standards established by the Department of Energy in 2014. (EPS convert household electric current into direct current or lower-voltage alternating current to operate a consumer product such as a laptop computer or smart phone.) Applies this exemption to EPS service parts or spare parts manufactured during the period from February 10, 2016, through February 10, 2020, for end-use products that were manufactured before February 10, 2016.

Requires such EPS parts to meet: (1) efficiency standards under the Act that were in effect prior to the issuance of the standards established in 2014, and (2) labeling and certification requirements under the External Power Supply International Efficiency Marking Protocol. Establishes reporting requirements for exempted EPS products.</summary>
