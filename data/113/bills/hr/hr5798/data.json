(Currently, the extended one-year period is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2014, and return to a nine-month period under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.)\n\nRevives, effective January 1, 2016 (currently, January 1, 2015), the old nine-month period in place of the one-year period granted by such Act."
