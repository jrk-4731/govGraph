  <summary date="2014-12-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Realign and Eliminate Duplicative Unnecessary Costly Excess in Government Act of 2014 or the REDUCE Government Act - Establishes the Federal&#160;Realignment and Closure Commission, which shall: (1) establish a systematic method for assessing the effectiveness and accountability of agency programs, excluding Department of Defense (DOD) programs; (2) divide the programs into three approximately equal budgetary groupings; (3) assess the effectiveness and accountability of all programs within a grouping in each of 2015, 2017, and 2019; and (4) by June 30 of each such year, submit a plan with recommendations of the agencies and programs that should be realigned or eliminated within the grouping assessed.

Requires the Commission to recommend: (1) the realignment of agencies or programs that are performing the same essential function that can be consolidated or streamlined into a single agency or program; and (2) the elimination of&#160;agencies or programs that have completed their intended purpose, have become irrelevant, or have failed to meet their objectives.&#160; Authorizes the Commission to recommend the realignment or elimination of any agency or program that has wasted federal funds by: (1) spending funds on items outside its authorized mission, (2) mismanaging resources and personnel, or (3) using such funds for personal benefit or the benefit of a special interest group.

Requires the President: (1) by August 15 of each such year, to transmit a report containing the President's approval or disapproval of the Commission's plan and recommendations; (2) to transmit a copy of an approved plan and recommendations to Congress; and (3) to eliminate or realign&#160; agencies and programs pursuant to such recommendations unless Congress enacts a resolution disapproving them.

Requires funds saved by implementation of such plan to be used for deficit reduction.</summary>
