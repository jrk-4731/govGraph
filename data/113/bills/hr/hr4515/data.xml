  <summary date="2014-04-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Getting into Researching, Learning, &amp; Studying of STEM Act of 2014 or the GIRLS-STEM Act of 2014 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award grants to local educational agencies that serve underrepresented or low-income students to enable their elementary and secondary schools to establish and implement programs that:

 encourage the ongoing interest of female students in careers requiring science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) skills at all levels of the career pathway; and prepare female students to pursue the industry-recognized credentials needed to pursue a STEM career. Requires the grants to be awarded in four-school-year increments.

Requires the grants to be used to:

 acquaint female students with, and prepare them to pursue, STEM careers; educate the parents of such students about the opportunities and advantages of STEM careers; provide female students with STEM tutoring, mentoring, after-school activities, and summer programs; expose female students to STEM role models, events, academic programs, or career and technical education programs; purchase education materials, equipment, or software that facilitate STEM instruction; assist female students in selecting secondary school courses that provide them with preparation for postsecondary education and experiential learning opportunities in STEM; facilitate STEM internships for such students; and provide teachers with training that enables them to more effectively teach STEM and overcome gender biases that discourage female students' advancement in those fields.</summary>
