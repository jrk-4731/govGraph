  <summary date="2014-05-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Coast Guard Regulation Relief Act of 2014 - Amends federal shipping law to revise requirements for recording of a notice of a claim of a maritime lien.

Declares that a notice shall expire three years after it is recorded. (Currently, expires three years after the lien was established.)

Authorizes a person to re-record an expired notice if that person submits to the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) a declaration that the information in the notice is accurate to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief. Extends the re-recorded notice for another three years.

Declares that the expiration of a notice may not be construed to have any effect on the validity of a claim of lien.</summary>
