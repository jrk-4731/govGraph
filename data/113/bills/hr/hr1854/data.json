Directs the Secretary to establish a program providing student loan forgiveness to non-participants in this Act's grant program who have been employed for at least five consecutive years as school counselors, school social workers, or psychologists by low-income LEAs.\n\nRequires the Secretary to identify a formula for future use in designating regions as eligible for benefit programs due to their having a shortage of such school personnel."
