  <summary date="2014-12-11T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to report to Congress&#160;regarding how sole source suppliers of components to the&#160;DOD procurement supply chain create vulnerabilities to military attack, terrorism, natural disaster, industrial shock, financial crisis, or geopolitical crisis, such as an embargo of key raw materials or industrial inputs.

Requires the report to include: (1) a list of the supply chain components for which there is a supplier that controls over 50% of the global market; (2)&#160;a list of parts of the supply chain where there is inadequate information to ascertain whether there is a single source supplier of components; and (3) the Secretary's recommendations on which single source suppliers create vulnerabilities and on how to reduce those vulnerabilities.</summary>
