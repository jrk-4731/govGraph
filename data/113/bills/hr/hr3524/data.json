Requires the Secretary to ensure that state and local boards within extremely economically disadvantaged areas receive 25% more authorized grant funds than those within economically disadvantaged areas.\n\nDefines \"economically disadvantaged area\" to mean any area for which there is a single five-digit postal zip code, and which includes any portion of a census tract where the median annual household income is less than $40,000 per year. Defines \"extremely economically disadvantaged area\" similarly, except for a median annual household income of less than $32,000 per year."
