Requires the Director of the Office of Information Policy of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to submit biennial reports to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committees on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Judiciary identifying categories of records that would be appropriate for proactive disclosure under FOIA.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires OMB to establish: (1) a three-year pilot program to review the benefits of a centralized portal to process requests and release information as required by FOIA, and (2) a plan to evaluate the functionality and benefits of such a portal to receive and track FOIA requests by selecting no fewer than three agencies that have not previously participated in such a portal.\n\nRequires the head of each federal agency participating in the pilot program to: (1) report to Congress on the impact of the program on agency processes under FOIA and on whether the agency will continue to participate in the centralized portal, and (2) make such report available in an electronic, publicly accessible format.\n\n(Sec. 4) Requires the Inspector General of each federal agency to: (1) periodically review compliance with FOIA disclosure requirements, including the timely processing of requests, the assessment of fees and fee waivers, and the use of disclosure exemptions; and (2) make recommendations to the head of an agency, including recommendations for disciplinary action. Makes the improper withholding of information under FOIA a basis for disciplinary action.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Archivist of the Untied States to establish an Open Government Advisory Committee as an independent advisory committee to make recommendations for improving government transparency.\n\n(Sec. 6) Prohibits the authorization of additional funds to carry out the requirements of this Act."
