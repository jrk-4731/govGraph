(Currently, that penalty may be imposed on a state for any fiscal year after the fiscal year the state reduces its special education funding.)\n\nRedistributes the federal special education funding that is denied to a penalized state to states that have not reduced their level of special education funding.\n\nProhibits the Secretary of Education from considering those penalties or redistributions when calculating a state's share of federal special education funds for subsequent fiscal years."
