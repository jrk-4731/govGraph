  <summary date="2014-04-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Requires the Director of the National Park Service to conduct a special resources study to determine the suitability and feasibility of entering into public-private partnerships with non-federal entities to operate East Potomac Golf Course, Langston Golf Course, and Rock Creek Park Golf Course in the District of Columbia.

Requires the Director to assume that: (1) one of the three golf courses will be a world-class, tournament-quality public course, with commensurate playing fees; and (2) the other two shall be public courses of substantially similar quality to top-ranked courses owned by cities, towns, and counties for which the playing fees shall remain the same as they are on the date of this Act's enactment but shall be indexed annually to the Consumer Price Index.</summary>
