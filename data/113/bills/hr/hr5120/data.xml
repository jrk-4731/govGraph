  <summary date="2014-07-22T15:57:33Z" status="Passed House amended">Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2014 - Title I: Innovation Management At Department of Energy - (Sec. 101) Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to rename the Under Secretary for Science as the Under Secretary for Science and Energy and expand the functions of the position to include establishment of appropriate linkages between offices under such official's jurisdiction.

(Sec. 102) Directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to: (1) report on its ability to improve the technology transfer and commercialization of energy technologies, including an assessment of the role and effectiveness of the Technology Transfer Coordinator position; and (2) recommend changes to improve the ability to successfully transfer new energy technologies to the private sector.

(Sec. 103) Expresses the sense of Congress regarding the development of a coordinated strategy for DOE nonmilitary national laboratories in the 21st century.

Title II: Cross-Sector Partnerships and Grant Competitiveness - (Sec. 201) Directs DOE to carry out the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program in accordance with this Act, including by giving the contractors of the DOE nonmilitary national laboratories (national laboratories) increased authority to negotiate contract terms and making every such facility eligible for the program.

Permits the directors of the national laboratories to execute agreements with non-federal entities, provided that such funding is only used to carry out the purposes of the federal award. Subjects agreements that are funding agreements to the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act (concerning patent rights to inventions arising from federally-supported research and development).

 Imposes contractor certification requirements for the avoidance of direct competition with the private sector and conflicts of interest.

Extends the pilot program for two years.

Requires DOE to report to Congress on the overall effectiveness of the pilot program and to annually account for, and justify, incidences of use by non-federal entities of funds derived from a federal contract or award to carry out agreements pursuant to the pilot program.

(Sec. 202) Requires the Secretary of Energy to delegate to the directors of the national laboratories signature authority with respect to certain agreements the total cost of which is less than $1 million.

(Sec. 203) Permits the directors of national laboratories to use funds authorized to support technology transfer within DOE to carry out early-stage and pre-commercial technology demonstration activities to: (1) remove technology barriers that limit private sector interest, and (2) demonstrate potential commercial applications of any research and technologies arising from national laboratory activities.

(Sec. 204) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to exempt institutions of higher education and nonprofit institutions from the cost-sharing requirements for research and development for six years.

(Sec. 205) Authorizes DOE to enter into an agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enable the participation of DOE researchers in the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps program.

Title III: Assessment of Impact - (Sec. 301) Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to Congress on the results of projects developed under this Act and on DOE efforts to promote technology transfer and private sector engagement at the national laboratories.</summary>
