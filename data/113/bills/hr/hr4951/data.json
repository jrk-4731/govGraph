Provides for additional increases or decreases based upon demand.\n\nProvides up to three visa waivers per fiscal year per state for physicians in academic medical centers.\n\nPermits dual intent for an alien coming to the United States to receive graduate medical education or training, or to take examinations required for graduate medical education or training.\n\nExempts from specified entry limitations H-1B nonimmigrant aliens seeking to enter the United States to pursue graduate medical education or training.\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize waiver of the two-year foreign residency requirement for an alien who has received graduate medical eduction or training in the United States and seeks to apply for an immigrant visa or permanent resident status if:\n\n the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) determines that VA facilities are not capable of furnishing covered health services to eligible veterans because they lack the required personnel or cannot provide timely and reasonable access; and the head of the appropriate state agency determines that the alien will practice medicine in a Veterans Health Administration facility, the alien physician's work is in the public interest, and such waiver would not cause the number of waivers allotted for that state for that fiscal year to exceed five."
