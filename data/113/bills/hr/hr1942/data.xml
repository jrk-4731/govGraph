  <summary date="2013-05-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Construction Quality Assurance Act of 2013 - Requires each solicitation by an executive agency for the procurement of construction in excess of $1 million to require each bidder to submit the name, business location, and nature of work of each subcontractor with whom such bidder will subcontract for work in excess of $100,000. Deems to be non-responsive, and prohibits consideration of, any bidder that fails to list such subcontractors.

Prohibits a contractor from substituting another subcontractor for a listed subcontractor, permitting any subcontract to be voluntarily assigned or transferred, or subcontracting work for which the contractor listed itself, except with the consent of the contracting officer for good cause. Sets forth: (1) examples of good cause and procedures required for substitution requests; and (2) penalties for violations of substitution prohibitions, including suspension or debarment from federal contracts for multiple violations. Requires revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement this Act.</summary>
