  <summary date="2014-01-25T04:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on January 8, 2014. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Poison Center Network Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize through FY2019: (1) a poison control nationwide-toll free phone number; and (2) a national media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison prevention and the availability of poison control center resources in local communities and to conduct advertising campaigns about the nationwide toll-free number.

Revises and reauthorizes through FY2019 a grant program for accredited (currently, certified) poison control centers. Allows grant funds to be used to research, improve, and enhance the communications and response capability and capacity of the poison control centers to facilitate increased access to such centers through the integration and modernization of communications and data systems.</summary>
