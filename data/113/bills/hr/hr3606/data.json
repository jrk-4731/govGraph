Prohibits any action from being taken to limit or exclude pack and saddle stock without an environmental analysis with a finding that the actions are necessary to preserve the wilderness character of the area to that which existed at the time of the designation.\n\nStates that historical uses and activities, including commercial outfitting and guiding, camping, pack stock grazing; and associated campfires, tent locations, and social trails are traditional uses. Requires signs of use created by these activities to be considered substantially unnoticeable and acceptable as long as they do not exceed the level present at the time of the designation. Requires the USDA to take actions to ensure that these levels are not exceeded.\n\nDirect the USDA to complete an updated wilderness plan to preserve pack and saddle stock use and all legally acceptable recreational uses within the area. Specifies requirements for the plan.\n\nRequires the USDA to continue to authorize commercial pack and saddle stock services and issue authorizations to provide commercial services for commercial stock operations within the area at historic levels. Requires the USDA to specify levels of use, user days, and activities by commercial outfitters and guides."
