  <summary date="2014-11-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Ebola Response Act of 2014 - Requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prohibit any individual from entering the United States for 30 days following the individual's presence in a country experiencing an Ebola outbreak.

Directs DHS and HHS to ensure that individuals who are nationals of or have recently been in a country experiencing an Ebola outbreak are certified by a medical professional as testing negative for Ebola and having a normal body temperature before they enter the United States and submit to 21 days of monitoring for Ebola symptoms.

Allows the President to exempt officials, employees, and contractors of the Department of State and the Department of Defense (DOD) from the requirements of this Act if there are sufficient measures in place to protect against the transmission of Ebola by these individuals.</summary>
