  <summary date="2013-08-10T03:59:59Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Revises certain minimum pipeline safety standards requirements to delay from January 3, 2012, to January 3, 2015, the requirement that the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) issue a regulation that incorporates by reference any pipeline safety regulatory documents or portions only if such documents are made available to the public, free of charge, on an Internet website.

Eliminates the prohibition against issuing guidance unless such requirements are met.

Eliminates also the restriction that such documents be made available to the public only on the Internet.</summary>
