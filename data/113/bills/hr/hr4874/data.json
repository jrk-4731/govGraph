Requires the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review and certify the accuracy of agency determinations of the cost of new rules.\n\nTitle III: Retrospective Review of New Rules - Requires a federal agency that makes a new rule to include in the final issuance of such rule a plan for reviewing the rule not later than 10 years after it is promulgated.\n\nTitle IV: Judicial Review - Makes agency compliance with the requirements of this Act subject to judicial review.\n\nTitle V: Miscellaneous Provisions - Defines terms used in this Act and makes it effective upon enactment."
