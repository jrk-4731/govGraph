Defines \"qualified real property interest\" as any interest in real property which is: (1) the entire interest of the taxpayer, (2) a remainder interest, or (3) a restriction (granted in perpetuity) on the use which may be made of the real property. Exempts such a sale or grant of a qualified real property interest from the application of estate tax property valuation rules."
