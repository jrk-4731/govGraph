Provides a formula for subsequent annual adjustments of the wage increase to ensure that it remains equal to 70% of the wage in effect under FLSA for other employees.\n\nDirects the Secretary, 60 days before any increase in the minimum wage, to publish it in the Federal Register and on the Department of Labor's website."
