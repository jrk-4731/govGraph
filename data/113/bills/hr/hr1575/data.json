Requires the law enforcement agency of such officer, within 48 hours after the officer makes such a request, to request a court order stating whether such officer had probable cause to believe that such conditions existed at the time of the request.\n\nShields a telecommunications carrier from any cause of action in any court or any civil or administrative proceeding commenced by a governmental entity for providing call location information in good faith in accordance with this Act."
