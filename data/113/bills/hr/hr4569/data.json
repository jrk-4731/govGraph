Directs the SEC to study ways to: (1) modernize and simplify requirements in regulation S-K, and (2) evaluate information delivery and presentation methods as well as explore methods to discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information.\n\nRequires the SEC to issue a proposed rule to implement any recommendations it makes to Congress based on the study."
