  <summary date="2014-07-23T03:59:59Z" status="Public Law">Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) to revise requirements and reauthorize appropriations for: (1) WIA title I, workforce development systems for job training and employment services; and (2) WIA title II, adult education and family literacy education programs. (Sec. 3) Defines "core programs" to mean: (1) youth workforce investment activities and adult and dislocated worker employment and training activities, (2) adult education and literacy activities, (3) employment services, and (4) vocational rehabilitation services.

Title I: Workforce Development Activities - Subtitle A: System Alignment - Chapter 1: State Provisions - (Sec. 101) Revises member composition of state workforce development boards (currently state workforce investment boards) to require at least 20% of a board to be composed of representatives of the workforce within the state.

Requires a state board to assist the state governor in: (1) the review of statewide policies, statewide programs, and recommendations on actions to be taken by a state to align statewide workforce development programs that support a comprehensive and streamlined statewide workforce development system, and (2) the development of a statewide workforce and labor market information system.

(Sec. 102) Requires states to have approved unified state plans with a four-year strategy for the core programs.

Requires unified state plans to include: (1) a strategy, based on certain analyses, for aligning the core programs, as well as other state resources, to achieve the state's vision and goals for preparing an educated and skilled workforce (including youth and individuals with barriers to employment) and meeting the skilled workforce needs of employers; (2) a description of state operating systems and policies for supporting that strategy; and (3) certain requirements and state assurances with respect to statewide and local workforce investment system and adult education and family literacy education programs.

(Sec. 103) Allows a state to develop for approval a combined state plan for the core programs and one or more of the programs and activities from a specified list.

Chapter 2: Local Provisions - (Sec. 106) Converts local workforce investment areas into local workforce development areas, and revises requirements for their designation by the state governor.

Requires a state, when developing a state plan, to identify regions composed of one local area or two or more local areas which are interstate areas contained within two or more states aligned with them.

Requires local boards and chief elected officials in planning regions composed of two or more local areas aligned with the region or interstate areas within two or more states to engage in a regional planning process that results in: (1) the preparation of a regional plan; (2) the establishment of regional service strategies, including use of cooperative service delivery agreements; (3) the development and implementation of sector initiatives for in-demand industry sectors or occupations; and (4) the collection and analysis of regional labor market data.

Requires local boards and chief elected officials within a planning region to have an approved regional plan that incorporates local plans for each of the local areas in the planning area.

Requires, in cases where a state is designated as a single state local area, that a local plan be approved as part of the state plan.

(Sec. 107) Revises requirements for local workforce development (currently, investment) boards, requiring at least 20% of a board to be composed of representatives of the local area workforce.

Requires a local board to conduct, and regularly update, a workforce research and regional labor market analysis and assist the state governor in developing a statewide workforce and labor market information system.
