  <summary date="2014-05-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">PACE Pilot Act of 2014 - Amends title XI (General Provisions, Peer Review, and Administrative Simplification) of the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to waive applicable general and Medicaid requirements of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for Elderly (PACE) in order to conduct demonstration projects through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations (CMMI) that involve PACE. Prohibits the Secretary, however, as part of a CMMI demonstration, from waiving: (1) the requirement to offer items and services under Medicare without limitations, and (2) certain requirements regarding enrollment in and disenrollment from PACE programs.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Secretary should use waiver authority under this Act to provide, in a budget neutral manner, PACE programs with increased operational flexibility to support their ability to improve and innovate and to reduce technical and administrative barriers that have hindered enrollment.</summary>
