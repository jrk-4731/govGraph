Requires that another 20% of such funds be used to pay directly to each county in which mining operations occurred an amount directly proportional to the portion of such money attributable to those operations.

Requires that moneys paid directly to such county be used by the county for its schools and roads.

Makes this Act inapplicable to Alaska and its counties.</summary>
