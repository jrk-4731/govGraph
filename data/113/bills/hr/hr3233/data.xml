  <summary date="2013-10-05T03:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 to provide that the total number of aliens eligible for special immigrant status (Iraqis who were employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq) during the first three months of FY2014 shall be the sum of: (1) the number of such aliens whose applications were pending on September 30, 2013, and (2) 2000. Imposes a deadline of December 15, 2013, for applications for special immigrant status.

Directs the Secretary of State to increase the fee or surcharge authorized under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 by $1 for processing machine-readable nonimmigrant visas and machine-readable combined border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas. Requires amounts collected as a result of the fee increase to be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury.</summary>
