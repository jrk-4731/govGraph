  <summary date="2013-04-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Infectious Disease Reporting Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report each case of reportable infectious disease (a disease that a state requires to be reported) that occurs at a medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to the appropriate state entity, as well as to the accrediting organization of such facility.

Requires the Secretary, upon a failure to report, to pay to a state the same penalty that a non-federal facility of such state would pay for a failure to report. Allows a state to file a civil action against the VA for the recovery of such amount.</summary>
