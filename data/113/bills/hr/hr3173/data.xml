  <summary date="2013-09-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Children's Consignment Event Recognition Act of 2013 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exclude from the meaning of "employee" subject to minimum wage and maximum hours requirements any individuals who volunteer their services at a children's consignment event with or without the assistance of a facilitator and meet certain other conditions.

Defines "children's consignment event" to mean a sale or other event in which: (1) at least 90% of the aggregate fair market value of items offered for sale are children's or maternity clothing, and resale items are offered for sale on consignment; and (2) the event is held open to the public in a single location for the sale of goods for 8 or fewer sale days within any 30-day period.</summary>
