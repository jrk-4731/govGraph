(Currently, the Secretary is required to award at least three grants, including at least one to a public entity, one to a private nonprofit entity, and one to a consortium of such entities, provided an application from each merits approval.)\n\nRevises the per-pupil facilities aid program (under which the Secretary makes competitive matching grants to states to provide per-pupil financing to charter schools) to allow states to: (1) partner with organizations to provide up to 50% of the state share of funding for the program; and (2) receive more than one program grant, so long as the amount of the grant funds provided to charter schools increases with each successive grant.\n\nDirects the Secretary to conduct national activities that include: (1) disseminating best practices and technical assistance to this Act's grantees; (2) developing, in partnership with the Institute for Education Sciences, performance metrics to evaluate charter school startup, replication, and expansion efforts; and (3) awarding competitive grants directly to charter school developers or charter management organizations to open new charter schools and expand and replicate high-quality charter schools.\n\nAllows charter schools to: (1) admit students through a lottery that gives added weight to impoverished students, if authorized by state law and the school's charter; and (2) serve prekindergarten or postsecondary school students.\n\nReauthorizes appropriations through FY2019."
