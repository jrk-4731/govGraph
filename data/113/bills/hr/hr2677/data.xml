  <summary date="2013-07-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Sequestration Tied to Member Pay (STOMP) Act of 2013 - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 with respect to the annual rate of compensation of Members of Congress.

Requires that if, during either of the two most recent fiscal years ending before a Congress, the effective annual rate of pay of federal employees is reduced because of a sequestration-related furlough, the annual rate of pay otherwise applicable for Members during the Congress be reduced by a percentage equal to the average percentage reduction in the effective annual rate of pay during the fiscal years for all federal employees.

Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), by December 15 of each even-numbered year, to determine and publish the percentage (if any) by which the Members' annual rate of pay otherwise applicable shall be reduced during the next Congress.</summary>
