Requires a special project manager to submit to specified congressional committees detailed plans of a covered project and progress reports, which shall include an analysis of all changes ordered by the VA and recommendations for improving the operation of any construction-related activity to reduce costs or complete the project in a more timely manner.\n\nDefines \"covered projects\" to mean each construction project that is a major medical facility project that: (1) was the subject of a report by the Comptroller General (GAO) titled \"Additional Actions Needed to Decrease Delays and Lower Costs of Major Medical-Facility Projects,\" published in April 2013; and (2) has not been activated to accept patients as of this Act's enactment.\n\n(Sec. 5) Prohibits additional funds from being authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act."
