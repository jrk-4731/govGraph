  <summary date="2014-09-27T03:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on July 29, 2014. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

 Examination and Supervisory Privilege Parity Act of 2014 - Amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, with respect to the supervision of nondepository covered persons, to include state agencies that licence, supervise, or examine the offering of consumer financial products or services among the regulatory agencies with which the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is required to coordinate its supervisory activities.

Declares that the sharing of information with such regulators, authorities, and agencies shall not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise affecting any privilege or confidentiality claimed by nondepository covered persons under federal or state law regarding such information as to any person or entity other than the CFPB, agency, supervisor, or authority.</summary>
