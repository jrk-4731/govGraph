Grants jurisdiction to a three-judge panel of a U.S. district court to hear such civil action and provides for an expedited direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to submit quarterly reports to the congressional judiciary committees on the costs of any civil action brought under this Act, incuding any&#160;attorney fees paid in connection with any such action.</summary>
