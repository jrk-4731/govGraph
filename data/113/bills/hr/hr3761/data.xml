  <summary date="2013-12-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exempt decorative hearth products from consideration as direct heating equipment subject to the Act's energy efficiency standards.

Defines a "decorative hearth product" as a vented gas fireplace, stove, gas fireplace insert, or gas log set that: (1) is not certified to the ANSI Z21.88 standard and, in the case of vented gas fireplaces, fireplace inserts, or stoves, is certified to the ANSI Z21.50 standard; (2) is sold without a thermostat and with a warranty provision expressly voiding manufacturer warranties in the event the product is used with a thermostat; and (3) contains no energy efficiency representations other than P.4 efficiencies required for products sold in Canada.

Adds the product category "vented hearth heater," defined as a vented gas fireplace, fireplace insert, or stove: (1) for which any AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency) representation, or representation with respect to P.4 efficiencies required for products sold in Canada, is made in any manufacturer advertising or literature; (2) certified to the ANSI Z21.88 standard or identified in any manufacturer literature or advertising as a "heater-rated" product; or (3) equipped by the manufacturer with a thermostatic control.

Deems a vented gas fireplace, fireplace insert, stove, or gas log set that is not a decorative hearth product to be direct heating equipment for purposes of the Act.</summary>
