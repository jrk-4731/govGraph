Requires the Director to: (1) coordinate with the Secretary of Defense and commanders of unified and specified combatant commands regarding Office plans or activities for operations, and (2) prescribe a Stabilization Federal Acquisition Regulation. Establishes the Stabilization and Reconstruction Fund.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the Director and Office staff should partner with the country in which an operation is taking place, other foreign government partners, international organizations, and local nongovernmental organizations throughout the planning, implementation, and the transition stages of such operations in order to facilitate long term capacity building and sustainability of initiatives.\n\nSets forth the duties of the Inspector General of the Office, including special audit and investigative authority and reporting requirements. Provides information coordination responsibilities of other federal agencies with respect to Office monitoring and evaluation requirements."
