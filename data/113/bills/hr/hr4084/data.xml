 creating new community gardens and supporting and expanding existing community gardens; recruiting local community members to actively engage in community gardens and gardening projects; transforming vacant places into community garden plots; increasing community members' access to healthy foods and local foods while also encouraging them to stay active; expanding anti-poverty efforts by teaching basic nutrition and self-reliance through community gardening; and developing initiatives that increase the community's access to healthy, locally grown foods.
