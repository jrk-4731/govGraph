  <summary date="2013-05-17T14:19:17Z" status="Reported to House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Amends the Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to adjust the boundaries of the North Cascades National Park and the Stephen Mather Wilderness in Washington state in order to provide a 100-foot wide corridor along which the Stehekin Valley Road may be rebuilt: (1) outside of the floodplain between mileposts 12.9 and 22.8, (2) within the boundaries of the Park, and (3) outside of the boundaries of the Wilderness.

Requires that the boundary adjustments be such that equal acreage amounts are exchanged between the Wilderness and the Park.</summary>
