The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment which prohibits anything in the Act from being construed to alter, delay, or weaken: 1) Section 1402 of the Affordable Care Act (which reduces out-of-pocket costs and cost-sharing for individuals and families); 2) Sections 1001 and 1401 of the Affordable Care Act (which provide tax credits and rebates for health insurance); or 3) Section 1201 of the Affordable Care Act (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of pre-existing conditions and gender). Subsequently, the reservation of a point of order was withdrawn.</text>
