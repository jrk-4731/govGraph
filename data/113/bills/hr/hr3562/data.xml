  <summary date="2013-11-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fairness in Obamacare Act of 2013 - Declares that Congress and the executive branch are expressly and equally bound by any federal law which is intended to be broadly enforced upon the American people.

Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to restrict the health plans that the federal government may make available to Members of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and appointed federal workers to only those health plans that are created under PPACA or offered through a health care exchange. (Currently, this restriction applies to Members of Congress and congressional staff.)

Defines "appointed federal worker" as an individual who is: (1) employed in a position listed in the Executive Schedule; (2) a limited term, limited emergency, or noncareer appointee in the Senior Executive Service; or (3) employed in an executive branch position of a confidential or policy-determining character under the regulations concerning excepted schedules.

Prohibits such restrictions from affecting the continued coverage of annuitants in certain plans under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program in effect as of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
