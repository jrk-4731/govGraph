(Currently, this restriction applies to Members of Congress and congressional staff.)\n\nDefines \"appointed federal worker\" as an individual who is: (1) employed in a position listed in the Executive Schedule; (2) a limited term, limited emergency, or noncareer appointee in the Senior Executive Service; or (3) employed in an executive branch position of a confidential or policy-determining character under the regulations concerning excepted schedules.\n\nProhibits such restrictions from affecting the continued coverage of annuitants in certain plans under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program in effect as of the enactment of this Act."
