  <summary date="2013-11-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Insurance Freedom Act of 2013 - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), with respect to the definition of a qualified health plan, to allow a health insurance issuer to offer coverage that: (1) provides the essential health benefits package required of a qualified health plan other than the minimum benefits required under the essential benefits and level of coverage requirements, and (2) meets federal and state benefit requirements as otherwise applied as of October 1, 2013, in the state in which the coverage is offered.

Makes such coverage ineligible: (1) for the premium assistance income tax credit or PPACA cost-sharing reductions; and (2) to be treated as a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan or be taken into account for purposes of determining the applicable second lowest cost silver plan.

Makes this Act's amendments effective as if they were included in the enactment of PPACA.</summary>
