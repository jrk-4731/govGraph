  <summary date="2013-05-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Secure Firearms Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow individual taxpayers a deduction, up to $1,200 in any taxable year, for the cost of secure gun storage or safety devices for the securing of firearms. Defines "secure gun storage or safety device" as: (1) a device that, when installed on a firearm, is designed to prevent the firearm from being operated; or (2) a safe, gun safe, gun case, lock box, or other device used to store a firearm that can only be unlocked by a key, a combination, or other similar means. Terminates such deduction after 2014.

Requires that an amount equal to all amounts allowed as a deduction by this Act be rescinded each year from the Department of Justice (DOJ) Assets Forfeiture Fund.</summary>
