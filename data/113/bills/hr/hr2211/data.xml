  <summary date="2013-05-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Accuracy in Reporting Medical Debt Act of 2013 - Amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to prohibit debt collectors, during a 120-day period, from reporting a medical debt (arising from the receipt of medical services, products, or devices) to any consumer reporting agency if the consumer, within a specified timeframe, disputes the validity of such debt through a written statement that the consumer is: (1) continuing to communicate with an insurance company to determine coverage for the debt, (2) disputing the amount or existence of the debt, or (3) awaiting a determination on an application for financial assistance when the consumer provides evidence of such application.

Prohibits this Act from having any effect on when a debt collector may engage in activities to collect or attempt to collect any debt owed or due or asserted to be owed.</summary>
