Sets forth standards for the development of guidelines, including related to transparency, the composition of the panel, and the review of existing evidence.\n\nDeclares that this Act does not preempt or supersede any state or federal law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for health care providers and health care organizations from liability, loss, or damages than those provided under this Act nor does it create a cause of action or preempt any defenses otherwise available.\n\nAllows a defendant to remove any health care liability action brought in a state court to a district court.\n\nRequires an independent medical review in health care liability actions if the eligible professionals allege that they adhered to applicable clinical practice guideline. Sets forth procedures for the use of the panel's findings at trial. Enables defendants to recover costs and attorneys' fees from plaintiffs if the defendants prevail subsequent to preliminary findings in their favor."
