Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study contrasting mandatory minimum sentencing laws and guidelines for narcotics-related offenses and Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutorial discretion in determining penalties for violations of anti-money laundering laws.\u00a0\n\nAuthorizes a court, in granting an injunction directed at money laundering activities, to issue a conditional or permanent ban on any individual who has violated money laundering laws from acting as an officer or director of a financial institution.\n\nGrants independent legal authority to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the Department of the Treasury to bring legal action to enforce anti-money laundering laws.\n\nRequires the issuance of regulations by appropriate federal banking agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and FinCEN prohibiting financial institutions that are subject to an anti-money laundering program requirement from providing executive compensation based on any criteria that could undermine compliance by any individual with anti-money laundering requirements.\u00a0Imposes personal liability on\u00a0officers, directors, employees, or affiliated parties of a financial institution for fines relating to money laundering violations.\n\nRequires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations requiring each financial institution that is subject to an anti-money laundering program to establish written policies, procedures, and risk management standards for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering requirements. Imposes civil liability on\u00a0officers or\u00a0employees of a financial institutions who knew or should have known about money laundering violations but who failed to take meaningful steps to stop such violations.\u00a0\n\nRequires each\u00a0 appropriate federal banking agency, the SEC, and the CFTC to report to FinCEN on each enforcement or supervisory action taken relating to an anti-money laundering violation.\n\nExpands: (1) criteria for granting safe harbor protections to financial institutions\u00a0that voluntarily disclose money laundering violations,\u00a0and (2) the types of crimes that can be a predicate offense to money laundering to include all felony offenses.\n\nExpands anti-discrimination protections and legal remedies for\u00a0individuals who provide information about money laundering violations (whistle blowers).\u00a0 Provides enhanced monetary incentives for such whistle blowers.\n\nDirects the Secretary to work with foreign counterparts and financial organizations\u00a0to promote stronger anti-money laundering frameworks and enforcement of anti-money laundering laws. \u00a0\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that DOJ should vigorously pursue criminal penalties against individuals who willfully violate anti-money laundering laws. Sets forth considerations for the Department of\u00a0 the Treasury when identifying countries or jurisdictions as primary money laundering concerns under the USA Patriot Act."
