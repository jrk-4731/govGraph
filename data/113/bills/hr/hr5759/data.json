States that such prohibition shall not apply:\n\n to the extent prohibited by the Constitution; upon the request of federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies for purposes of maintaining aliens in the United States to be tried for crimes or to be trial witnesses; or for humanitarian purposes where the aliens are at imminent risk of serious bodily harm or death. Declares that any executive branch action intending to circumvent the objectives of this Act shall be null and void and without legal effect.\n\n States that this Act shall take effect as if enacted on November 20, 2014, and shall apply to requests (whether the request is original or for reopening of a previously denied request) submitted on or after that date for: (1) work authorization; or (2) exemption from, or deferral of, removal."
