The instructions contained in the motion seek to report the same back to the House forthwith with an amendment to ensure that nothing in the underlying legislation would impact the relief provided to parents, spouses, and children of U.S. citizens who are current members or veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, or who seek to enlist in the Armed Forces, which is consistent with current law, but will be halted by the underlying legislation. Additionally, the motion would protect victims of domestic violence who have successfully petitioned for relief under the Violence Against Women Act; and victims of crimes and serious forms of human trafficking from further abuse. Lastly, the motion would protect Cuban nationals or any                persons of any other nationality deserving of  such protections,            already in the U.S. or in tran sit to the U.S..

  <summary date="2014-12-04T16:06:38Z" status="Passed House amended">Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act of 2014 - Prohibits the executive branch of the government from:

 exempting or deferring from removal, by executive order, regulation, or any other means, categories of aliens considered under the immigration laws to be unlawfully present in the United States; treating such aliens as if they were lawfully present or had a lawful immigration status; or treating them other than as unauthorized aliens. States that such prohibition shall not apply:

 to the extent prohibited by the Constitution; upon the request of federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies for purposes of maintaining aliens in the United States to be tried for crimes or to be trial witnesses; or for humanitarian purposes where the aliens are at imminent risk of serious bodily harm or death. Declares that any executive branch action intending to circumvent the objectives of this Act shall be null and void and without legal effect.

 States that this Act shall take effect as if enacted on November 20, 2014, and shall apply to requests (whether the request is original or for reopening of a previously denied request) submitted on or after that date for: (1) work authorization; or (2) exemption from, or deferral of, removal.</summary>
