  <summary date="2013-07-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Wildland Firefighters Protection Act - Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in cooperation with federal land management agencies, to develop a separate and distinct occupational series for firefighters who are engaged in the prevention, control, suppression, and management of wildfires (wildland firefighters) that more accurately reflects the variety of duties performed by such firefighters.

Establishes a three-year compensation pilot program for full- and part-time wildland firefighters to provide such firefighters with enhanced compensation (portal-to-portal compensation) while assigned to an emergency incident. Provides for the treatment of differential pay for hazardous duty as part of the base pay of wildland firefighters for retirement purposes.</summary>
