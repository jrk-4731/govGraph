  <summary date="2013-03-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Asthma Management Plans in School Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award grants to schools that are receiving school improvement funds under part A of title I of the Act and are located in areas that have a high prevalence of asthma so they can: (1) develop and implement an asthma management plan; and (2) purchase the asthma inhalers, nebulizer machines, valved holding chambers (VHCs), spacers, auto-injectable epinephrine, and other supplies necessary for the relief and treatment of affected students.

Authorizes the Secretary to award grants to local health or education departments to carry out such activities if they are the entities that would routinely carry out such activities in an area.

 Requires grantees to: (1) find innovative ways to encourage rapid bidirectional communication between schools and students' physicians and students' adherence to asthma treatment, and (2) ensure that they have on staff a nurse or individual who is trained to administer emergency asthma care.</summary>
