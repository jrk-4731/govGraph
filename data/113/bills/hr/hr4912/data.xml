  <summary date="2014-06-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Prohibits funds made available to the Department of Defense (DOD) from being obligated or expended to support any U.S. or Iraqi combat activities in or around Iraq.

Defines "combat activities" to include the use of U.S. military personnel or equipment in direct physical conflict, or in combat supporting roles, including trainers or advisors.

Allows funds to be made available until 90 days after the enactment of this Act to protect the safety of, or to evacuate, U.S. nationals, including military, diplomatic, and contractor personnel.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to preclude the President from: (1) arranging asylum or other means of protection for Iraqi nationals who may be physically endangered because of associations with the U.S. government, (2) conducting intelligence activities necessary to protect U.S. interests, or (3) providing humanitarian assistance.</summary>
