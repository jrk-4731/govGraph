(Currently, rules go into effect unless Congress disapproves of the rule.) Nullifies EPA's existing major rules, unless the EPA submits them for congressional review.\n\nLowers the annual economic impact from $100 million to $50 million for a rule is deemed to be a major rule. Expands the criteria for an EPA regulation to be deemed a major rule to include that the regulation will have a significant impact on a substantial number of agriculture entities or it will implement a carbon tax.\n\nExpands the EPA's reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to include: a classification of each rule as a major or nonmajor rule with an explanation of the economic effects of the rule, related regulatory actions taken by EPA or another agency, and any jobs added or lost.\n\nAllows Congress to consider approval of a major rule only once in a Congress. Gives Congress 70 session days or legislative days to approve a rule.\n\nRequires the GAO to estimate the economic cost imposed by all of EPA's rules."
