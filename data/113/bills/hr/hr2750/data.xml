  <summary date="2014-12-12T13:47:17Z" status="Reported to House amended">Design-Build Efficiency and Jobs Act of 2014 - Modifies the procedure for awarding civilian and defense agency design and construction contracts for federal buildings and facilities to require: (1) a contracting officer to provide a written justification to the head of a federal agency for requiring more than five finalists in the bidding process for such contracts and agency approval of such justification; and (2) the use of the two-phase selection process (i.e., the submission of qualifications and then the submission of price and technical proposals in response to a request for proposal) for contracts having a value of $1.5 million or greater, unless the agency head approves the contracting officer's justification that procedures other than two-phase selection procedures are in the best interest of the federal government.

Requires each civilian and defense agency to submit to the Comptroller General (GAO) and publish in the Federal Register, during a five-year period, annual reports on all cases in the preceding year in which: (1) more than five finalists were selected for phase-two requests for competitive proposals; or (2) two-phase selection procedures involving contracts with a value of $1.5 million or more were not used. Requires the Comptroller General to publish a report on agency compliance with the requirements of this Act.</summary>
