(Eliminates the requirement, under current law, that the employee have served at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period before the leave request.)\n\nAmends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require that certain employees working at less than full-time under participation, vesting, and accrual rules governing pension plans be treated as meeting full-time year-of-service criteria. Qualifies such workers for group health plans. Extends ERISA coverage to certain individuals whose services are leased or contracted for."
