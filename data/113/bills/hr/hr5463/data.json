Directs the President to suspend foreign military sales and financing under the Arms Export Control Act to a listed country that has not taken actions to restrict persons in that country from providing material or financial support to ISIL.\n\nAmends the Arms Export Control Act to apply the same transaction prohibitions provided for by that Act against countries supporting acts of international terrorism to a country whose government has knowledge of persons within its territory that provide material support for terrorist organizations, including selling materials that produce income for such organizations."
