  <summary date="2013-04-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">School Safety Enhancements Act of 2013 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize school security grants by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services to be used for the installation of surveillance equipment and the establishment of hotlines or tiplines for the reporting of potentially dangerous students and situations.

Requires the Office Director: (1) in collaboration with the Secretary of Education, to establish an interagency task force to develop a set of advisory school safety guidelines; and (2) to consider such guidelines in determining permissible uses of school security grant funds.

Requires a grant application to be accompanied by a report that is signed by the heads of each law enforcement agency and school district with jurisdiction over the schools where the safety improvements will be implemented and that demonstrates that each proposed use of the grant funds will be: (1) an effective means for improving school safety, (2) consistent with a comprehensive approach to preventing school violence, and (3) individualized to the needs of each school.

Authorizes appropriations for such grant program for FY2014-FY2023.</summary>
