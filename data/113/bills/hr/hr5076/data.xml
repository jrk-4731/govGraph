Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims of Youth Trafficking Act of 2014 - Amends the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act with respect to grants to states, localities, and private entities to carry out research, evaluation, demonstration, and service projects regarding activities designed to increase knowledge concerning, and to improve services for, runaway youth and homeless youth.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to give priority to proposed projects relating to staff training in: (1) the behavioral and emotional effects of severe forms of trafficking in persons and sex trafficking, (2) responding to youth who are showing effects of severe forms of trafficking in persons and sex trafficking, and (3) agency-wide strategies for working with runaway and homeless youth who are victims of trafficking.

Extends the Secretary's authority to make grants to nonprofit private agencies for the purpose of providing street-based services to runaway and homeless, and street youth, who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, prostitution, or sexual exploitation. Extends the scope of such grants also to street-based services to runaway and homeless, and street youth, who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, severe forms of trafficking in persons and sex trafficking.</summary>
