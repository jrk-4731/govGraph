(A federal implementation plan is created due to the failure of an SIP to contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions activity which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, another state with any national ambient air quality standard.) Prohibits a state from being subjected to penalties for an inadequate SIP until these conditions are met.\n\nProhibits the EPA from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing a federal implementation plan due to the failure of an SIP to comply with the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule unless the EPA: (1) takes into consideration the Supreme Court's decision in Environmental Protection Agency et al. v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., et al., (2) publishes a final notice indicating the EPA's intent to enforce the rule, and (3) provides states with at least two years from the publication date to revise their SIPs. Prohibits a state from being subject to penalties for the failure of a SIP to comply with the rule until these conditions are met."
