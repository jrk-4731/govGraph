  <summary date="2014-01-29T13:21:14Z" status="Reported to House without amendment, Part I">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (the Secretary with respect to lands under the respective jurisdiction), for any film crew of five persons or fewer, to require a permit and assess an annual fee of $200 for commercial filming activities or similar projects on federal lands and waterways administered by the Secretary. Makes such a permit valid for such activities or projects that occur in areas designated for public use during public hours on all federal lands and waterways administered by the Secretary for a 12-month period.

Prohibits the Secretary, for persons holding such a permit, from assessing any additional fee for commercial filming activities and similar projects that occur in those areas during those hours.

Bars the Secretary from prohibiting, as a motorized vehicle or under any other purposes, the use of cameras or related equipment used for commercial filming activities or similar projects in accordance with this Act on federal lands and waterways administered by the Secretary.

Requires the Secretary to recover (under current law, collect) costs incurred as a result of filming activities or similar projects, including but not limited to, administrative and personnel costs.</summary>
