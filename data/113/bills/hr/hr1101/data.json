Prohibits the authorization or appropriation of federal funds for the Fund or for implementing the reinsurance liquidity protection program.\n\nEstablishes a post-catastrophe market stabilization program for liquidity loans to: (1) expedite payment of claims under state catastrophe insurance programs, (2) authorize the Secretary to issue loans to assist financial recovery from significant natural catastrophes, and (3) promote the availability of private capital to state catastrophe insurance programs in order to provide liquidity and capacity.\n\nEstablishes the National Readiness, Preparedness and Mitigation Committee to administer a Readiness, Preparedness, and Mitigation Grant Program of grants to state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate public and private entities to develop programs and initiatives to improve catastrophe response, citizen preparedness and protection, and prevention and mitigation of losses from natural catastrophes."
