(Thus eliminates congressional review of such Acts).\n\nRepeals the federal cap on amounts the District may borrow (other than in a control year).\n\nRepeals the application of the Federal Anti-Deficiency Act to the District government. Makes conforming amendments to the Act.\n\nMakes conforming amendments to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2009."
