  <summary date="2014-12-10T17:45:30Z" status="Reported to Senate without amendment">Authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to accept certain non-federal lands in California outside the boundaries of the Inyo National Forest in exchange for certain federal land within the Forest boundaries.

Authorizes USDA to accept a cash payment of any size to equalize the values of the properties that would be exchanged. (Current law limits the payments to no more than 25% of the value of the federal lands exchanged.) Requires deposit of the payment into the Treasury account established under the Sisk Act, which shall make funds available for USDA to acquire lands in California to add to the National Forest System.

Declares that this Act does not grant USDA new land exchange authority.</summary>
