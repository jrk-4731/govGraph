Authorizes the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights to impose a civil penalty on an IHE that has violated a law under the jurisdiction of the Department's Office for Civil Rights.\n\nAmends the Clery Act to direct the Secretary to develop an annual sexual violence climate survey and include statistics from such survey in the annual campus security report provided to current and prospective students and employees.\n\nCreates a private right of action in a judicial proceeding for individuals allegedly aggrieved by a violation of the Clery Act.\n\nIncreases the maximum monetary penalty that may be imposed on an IHE for substantially misrepresenting the number, location, or nature of the crimes required to be reported under the Clery Act.\n\nRequires an IHE's annual statement of its policy regarding domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking to:\n\n use simple and understandable language and clear formatting; be made available and posted on its public website and in conspicuous places in and around student housing and academic buildings; be provided to each student group, team, or organization that has a specified connection to the IHE or is known by the IHE to act on an unaffiliated basis; and ensure that each of those student groups, teams, or organizations distributes a copy of such policy to each of its members or applicants for membership. Directs the Secretary and the Attorney General to create a joint interagency Campus Sexual Violence Task Force, the duties of which include:\n\n providing IHEs with recommendations for preventing and responding to campus sexual violence; reviewing the Department's authority to levy intermediate fines for noncompliance with Title IX and the advisability of additional remedies for such noncompliance; and creating a plan for recruiting, retaining, and training a highly qualified Department of Education workforce to investigate alleged violations of and enforce Title IX and the Clery Act with respect to campus sexual violence. Authorizes funding to train, hire, and retain such a workforce."
