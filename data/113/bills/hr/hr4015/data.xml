  <summary date="2014-03-14T15:12:36Z" status="Passed House amended">SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 - (Sec. 2) Amends part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) end with 2013 the current formula for an update to the single conversion factor in the formula for payment for physicians' services, (2) end and remove sustainable growth rate (SGR) methodology from the determination of such annual conversion factors, (3) prescribe an update to the single conversion factor for 2014-2018 of 0.5%, (4) freeze the update to the single conversion factor at 0.00% for 2019-2023, and (5) establish for 2024 and subsequent years an update of 1% for health professionals participating in alternative payment models (APMs) and an update of 0.5% for all other health professionals.

Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to report to Congress on the relationship between: (1) physician and other health professional utilization and expenditures (and their rates of increase) of items and services for which Medicare payment is made, and (2) total utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) under Medicare parts A (Hospital Insurance), B, and D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program).

Directs MEDPAC to report to Congress on: (1) the payment update for professional services applied for 2014-2018; (2) the effect of that update on the efficiency, economy, and quality of care; (3) the update's effect on ensuring a sufficient number of providers to maintain access to care by Medicare beneficiaries; and (4) recommendations for any future payment updates to ensure adequate access to care is maintained for such beneficiaries.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) by consolidating (with certain revisions) the existing: (1) electronic health record (EHR) meaningful use incentive program, (2) quality reporting program, and (3) value-based payment program.

 Applies the MIPS program to payments for items and services furnished on or after January 1, 2018.

Requires MIPS-eligible professionals (excluding most APM participants) to receive annual payment increases or decreases based on their performance.

Defines MIPS-eligible professional as: (1) a physician, a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, and a certified registered nurse anesthetist during the MIPS program's first two years, and (2) also other eligible professionals specified by the Secretary for succeeding years.

 Excludes from treatment as a MIPS eligible professional any eligible professional who is: (1) a qualifying APM participant; (2) a partial qualifying APM participant for the most recent period for which data are available and who, for the performance period with respect to that year, does not report on applicable measures and activities a MIPS professional is required to report; or (3) does not exceed, for that performance period, a specified low-volume threshold measurement.

Qualifies for MIPS incentive payments a partial qualifying APM participant who reports on applicable measures and activities a MIPS professional is required to report.

Prescribes requirements for: (1) application of the MIPS program to group practices; and (2) measures and activities under the performance categories of quality, resource use, clinical practice improvement, and meaningful use of EHR technology.

Requires the Secretary, on an ongoing basis, to: (1) estimate how an individual's health status and other risk factors affect quality and resource use outcome measures; (2) incorporate information from quality and resource use outcome measurements (including care episode and patient condition groups) into the MIPS; and (3) account for identified factors with an effect on those measures when determining payment adjustments, composite performance scores, scores for performance categories, or scores for measures or activities under the MIPS. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish performance standards for the MIPS program, taking into account historical performance standards, improvement rates, and the opportunity for continued improvement; and (2) develop a methodology for assessing the total performance of each MIPS eligible professional according to such standards with respect to applicable measures and activities for each performance category, leading to a composite performance score for each professional for each performance period.

Directs the Secretary to specify a MIPS adjustment factor for each MIPS eligible professional for a year according to a formula taking into account composite performance scores above or below a performance threshold, including those at or above an additional performance threshold (for exceptional performance).

Makes appropriations for 2018-2023 from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for MIPS payments resulting from additional MIPS adjustment factors.

Prescribes a formula for the calculation of MIPS program incentive payments, beginning with 2018, subject to criteria for budget neutrality as well as a process for review of the calculation of an individual professional's MIPS program incentive payment adjustment factor for a year.

Directs the Secretary to make available on the Physician Compare website of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) certain information, including information regarding the performance of MIPS-eligible professionals.

Directs the Secretary to enter into contracts or agreements with appropriate entities (such as quality improvement organizations, regional extension centers, or regional health collaboratives) to offer guidance and assistance about performance categories or transition to an APM to MIPS-eligible professionals in practices of 15 or fewer professionals (with priority given to practices located in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, medically underserved areas, and practices with low composite performance scores).
