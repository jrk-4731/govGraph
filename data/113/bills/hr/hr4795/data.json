(Sec. 3) Requires the EPA to publish concurrently regulations and guidance for implementing any final rule establishing or revising a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Prohibits a NAAQS from applying to the review and disposition of a permit application until the EPA has met this requirement.\n\nProhibits this Act from being construed to eliminate the obligation of a preconstruction permit applicant to install best available control technology and the lowest achievable emissions rate technology.\n\n(Sec. 4) Requires the EPA to submit annually a report on actions to expedite the process for review of preconstruction permits."
