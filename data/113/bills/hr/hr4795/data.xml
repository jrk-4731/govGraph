  <summary date="2014-11-20T13:30:52Z" status="Passed House amended">Promoting New Manufacturing Act - (Sec. 2) Requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to publish on its website for FY2008 and each subsequent fiscal year:

 the total number of preconstruction permits issued annually under the Clean Air Act's New Source Review Program for the construction or modification of a major emitting facility or major stationary source (any stationary facility or source of air pollutants which directly emits, or has the potential to emit, 100 tons per year or more of any air pollutant); the percentage of permits issued within one year of the application; and the average length of time for the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board to decide appeals of decisions to grant or deny a permit. (Sec. 3) Requires the EPA to publish concurrently regulations and guidance for implementing any final rule establishing or revising a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Prohibits a NAAQS from applying to the review and disposition of a permit application until the EPA has met this requirement.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to eliminate the obligation of a preconstruction permit applicant to install best available control technology and the lowest achievable emissions rate technology.

(Sec. 4) Requires the EPA to submit annually a report on actions to expedite the process for review of preconstruction permits.</summary>
