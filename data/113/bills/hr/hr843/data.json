Prohibits funding from being used for the administration of a management conference for the San Francisco estuary under the National Estuary Program.\n\nRequires the Administrator, in developing the priority list, to consult with and consider the recommendations of: (1) the San Francisco Estuary Partnership, (2) the state of California and affected local governments in the San Francisco Bay estuary watershed, and (3) any other relevant stakeholder involved with the protection and restoration of such estuary.\n\nLimits funding amounts under this Act to 75% of the total cost of eligible activities to be carried out using those amounts.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to carry out this Act for each of FY2013-FY2017."
