  <summary date="2013-11-21T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Show Your Exemption Act - Requires the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives and the Financial Clerk of the Senate to make publicly available the determinations of each Member of the House of Representatives and each Senator regarding the designation of their congressional staff (including leadership and committee staff) as "official" for purposes of requiring such staff to enroll in health insurance coverage provided through a health benefit exchange as required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Requires the failure to designate any staff as "official" to be noted in the determination along with a statement that such failure permits the staff involved to remain in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.</summary>
