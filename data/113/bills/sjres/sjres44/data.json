    "text": "Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant - Authorizes the President for one year, as part of a multinational coalition, to:\n\n use all appropriate force to participate in an air campaign in Iraq, and if necessary, in Syria, to degrade and defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); and provide military equipment and training to forces fighting ISIL in Iraq or Syria, including the Iraqi security forces, Kurdish fighters, and other legitimate non-terrorist opposition groups in Syria. States that such authorization does not include:\n\n the use of U.S. ground combat forces, except to provide military equipment and training to forces fighting ISIL in Iraq or Syria, to protect or rescue U.S. Armed Forces members or U.S. citizens from imminent danger posed by ISIL, or for limited operations against high value targets; or the use of force against forces associated with ISIL, unless such forces are identified as fighting alongside ISIL in Iraq and Syria. Declares that this resolution is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization pursuant to section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.\n\n Repeals the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.\n\nDirects the President to submit to Congress every 90 days a list of those organizations or individuals fighting alongside ISIL for purposes of actions taken pursuant to this joint resolution.\n\nStates that nothing in this resolution shall be construed as:\n\n authorizing support for force in support of, or in cooperation with, the national government of Syria that was in power as of the enactment of this resolution, or its security services; or limiting the constitutional or statutory powers of the President or Congress or any additional powers held by the United States pursuant to international law or treaty."
