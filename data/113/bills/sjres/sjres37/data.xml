  <summary date="2014-06-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Constitutional Amendment - States that the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right.

Declares further that the parental right to direct education includes the right to choose public, private, religious, or home schools, and the right to make reasonable choices within public schools for one's child.

States that neither the United States nor any state shall infringe upon this right without demonstrating that its governmental interest, as applied to the person, is of the highest order and not otherwise served.

Prohibits this article from being construed to apply to a parental action or decision that would end life.

Declares that no treaty may be adopted nor shall any source of international law be employed to supersede, modify, interpret, or apply to the rights guaranteed by this amendment.</summary>
