Authorization for the Use of Military Force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Authorizes the President to use the U.S. Armed Forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or associated persons or forces.

Declares that this resolution is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization pursuant to section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution.

States that the authority granted by this resolution does not authorize use of the U.S. Armed Forces for ground combat operations except as necessary:

 for the protection or rescue of U.S. Armed Forces members or U.S. citizens from imminent danger posed by ISIL; or to conduct missions not intended to result in ground combat operations by U.S. forces, such as intelligence collection and sharing, enabling kinetic strikes, operational planning, or other forms of advice and assistance to forces fighting ISIL in Iraq or Syria. Terminates such military use authorization in three years.</summary>
