  <summary date="2014-06-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that:

 actions by officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) represent a clear violation of the public's trust in the VA to provide veterans with access to quality health care and warrant criminal investigation, the inability of the Administration to objectively investigate its own wrongdoing warrants the appointment of a Special Counsel to determine whether VA mismanagement and misconduct were criminal, and the appointment of a Special Counsel would be in the public interest.</summary>
