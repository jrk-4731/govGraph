Calls upon European parliamentarians to promote racial equality and combat racial discrimination through efforts such as introducing legislation, speaking out in their parliaments against racism, and working with Black European and other minority communities to develop relevant policies.

Urges the Secretary of State to: (1) increase support for the Experts Working Group on People of African Descent, and (C) appoint a Senior Advisor on Afro-descent peoples at the Department of State.

Supports the adoption of a "Joint Action Plan on Racial and Ethnic Equality and Inclusion" between the European Union (EU) and the United States and implementation of the Resolution on Strengthening Efforts to Combat Racism and Xenophobia and Foster Inclusion.</summary>
