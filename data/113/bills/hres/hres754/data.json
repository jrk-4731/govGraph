    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCalls on the government of Iran to abide by its international and domestic obligations regarding human rights and civil liberties, including freedoms of assembly, speech, and press.\n\nDeplores: (1) the dramatic rise in executions of Iranian citizens by authorities since the election of President Hassan Rouhani in June 2013, and (2) Iran's mistreatment of its religious minorities.\n\n Condemns: (1) the recent execution of Reyhaneh Jabbari, a woman convicted of killing a man she said she stabbed in self-defense during a sexual assault; (2) the relentless persecution of the Baha'i minority; and (3) the undemocratic elections process that denies Iranians the ability to freely choose their own government.\n\nCalls on Iran to release all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.\n\nNotes that the Administration has designated only one Iranian person for the commission of serious human rights abuses under the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act since May 30, 2013.\n\nUrges the President to increase the utilization of all available authorities, including the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, to impose sanctions on Iranian officials and others responsible for serious human rights abuses, including by freezing assets and barring U.S. entry.\n\nUrges the U.S. government to adopt and implement the following recommendations of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom regarding Iran:\n\n to seek that violations of freedom of religion and related human rights are part of discussions with Iran, and to work with allies to apply pressure through advocacy, diplomacy, and targeted sanctions; to speak out at the highest levels about the severe religious freedom abuses in Iran, to work for the release of all prisoners of conscience, and to highlight the need for the international community to hold authorities accountable; and to call on Iran to cooperate fully with and allow the United Nations (U.N.) Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights Situation in Iran to visit Iran. Stands with the people of Iran who seek the opportunity to freely elect a government of their choosing."
