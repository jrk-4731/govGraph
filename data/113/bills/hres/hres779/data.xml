 initiating war without express congressional authorization; killing American citizens in the United States or abroad who are not engaged in active hostilities against the United States without due process (unless the citizen was under indictment for a felony and the killing was necessary to prevent imminent serious physical danger to third parties); failing to superintend subordinates guilty of chronic constitutional abuses; expending money in violation of conditions imposed for the expenditure of appropriated funds; intentionally lying to Congress to obtain an authorization for war; failing to take care that the laws be faithfully executed through signing statements or systematic policies of non-enforcement; substituting executive agreements for treaties; intentionally lying under oath to a federal judge or grand jury; misusing federal agencies to advance a partisan political agenda; and refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents or testimony issued for a legitimate legislative purpose. Makes this Act effective January 20, 2017.</summary>
