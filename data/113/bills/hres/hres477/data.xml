  <summary date="2014-02-11T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Urges the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to: (1) work within the United Nations (U.N.) framework and with Greece to achieve longstanding U.S. and U.N. policy goals by finding a mutually acceptable name that must apply for all internal and international uses for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and (2) abstain from all hostile activities and stop violating the U.N.-brokered Interim Agreement between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece regarding hostile activities or propaganda.

 Urges the United States to work in partnership with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to uphold certain NATO decisions and extend an invitation to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached within the U.N. framework.

 Expresses the view of the House of Representatives that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia can be considered for accession into the European Union (EU) only after a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue has been reached within the U.N. framework.</summary>
