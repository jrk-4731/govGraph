  <summary date="2013-06-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses condolences to the families of those: (1) who were killed, wounded, tortured, or imprisoned because of their participation in the June 1989 demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, People's Republic of China; and (2) who continue to face persecution, torture, or imprisonment because of their involvement with those demonstrations.

 Honors the advocates who continue to struggle for democracy and human rights in China.

 Condemns China's: (1) oppression of peaceful religious minorities, such as Buddhists, the Uyghur people, Falun Gong practitioners, and other spiritual movements; and (2) human rights abuses in seeking to quell political dissent and oppress religious minorities.

 Calls on China to: (1) end the harassment, torture, and imprisonment of Chinese citizens expressing their legitimate freedom of religion, expression, and association; (2) release the remaining 1989 pro-democracy prisoners of conscience; (3) end the oppression of the Uyghur community and the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners; and (4) release U.S. permanent resident Dr. Wang Bingzhang.</summary>
