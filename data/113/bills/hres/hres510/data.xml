  <summary date="2014-03-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Encourages the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to use its existing budget and authority to establish a pilot partnership with nonprofit organizations that hold prior experience and expertise in diverse community outreach and trial accrual to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of NIH clinical trials, increase patient enrollment and retention in such trials, and address the lack of diversity in such trials.

Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the goals of the pilot partnership should include providing clinical trial navigation services to help patients find, enroll, and manage logistical issues related to enrollment and retention in federally supported clinical trials and to improve participation by populations such as underrepresented and uninsured individuals in such trials.</summary>
