  <summary date="2013-06-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should seek through negotiated agreements under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the elimination of all direct and indirect subsidies benefitting the production or export of sugar by any foreign country that: (1) exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar during 2013, or (2) has in effect a free trade agreement with the United States.

Urges the President to: (1) report to Congress detailed information about how any of such countries has eliminated such subsidies, and (2) then propose legislation to implement a "zero for zero" sugar subsidy policy.</summary>
