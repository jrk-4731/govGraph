  <summary date="2013-11-21T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) law enforcement, judges, child welfare agencies, and the public should treat children being trafficked for sex as victims of child abuse; (2) every effort should be made to arrest and hold accountable both traffickers and buyers of children for sex, in accordance with federal laws to protect victims of trafficking and state child protection laws; (3) the child welfare system requires reform to better prevent domestic child sex trafficking and aid the victims; and (4) such system should identify, assess, and provide supportive services to children in its care who are victims of sex trafficking or at risk of becoming such victims.

Expresses support for: (1) survivors of domestic child sex trafficking, including for the services they need to heal; and (2) an end to demand for girls by declaring that our nation's daughters are not for sale and that any person who purchases a child for sex should be held accountable with the full force of the law.</summary>
