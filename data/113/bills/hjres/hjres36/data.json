States, however, that spending for any fiscal year is not required to be less than 16% of the estimated GDP.\n\nRequires a three-fifths rollcall vote of each chamber to increase the public debt limit. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget (budget plan) to Congress annually. Prohibits any bill to increase revenue from becoming law unless approved by a three-fifths majority of the whole number of each chamber by rollcall vote. Requires the budget plan to include a justification by each federal department or agency for any funding proposed in that plan. Authorizes waivers of these requirements: (1) when a declaration of war is in effect or under other specified circumstances involving military conflict, or (2) during declaration of a natural disaster."
