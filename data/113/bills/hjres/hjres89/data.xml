Excepted Employees' Pay Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 - Makes appropriations for FY2014 to pay the salaries and related expenses of federal employees excepted from provisions of the Antideficiency Act (prohibiting any expenditure or obligation that exceeds an amount available in an appropriation or other fund) who work during the period beginning October 1, 2013, and ending December 15, 2013. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to report to the congressional Appropriations Committees specifying the use of funds made available to the executive branch by this joint resolution.

Expresses the sense of Congress that this joint resolution may be referred to as the Federal Worker Pay Fairness Act.

Deficit Reduction and Economic Growth Working Group Act of 2013 - Establishes the Bicameral Working Group on Deficit Reduction and Economic Growth, comprised of 20 Members of Congress, to recommend to the House of Representatives and Senate overall levels of discretionary spending, including for FY2014, changes in the statutory limit on the public debt, and reforms in direct spending programs.

Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the Senate to each appoint 10 members of their respective chamber to serve on the Working Group. Designates a co-chair in each chamber and allows the Minority Leaders of the House and Senate to each recommend the appointment of 4 of the 10 members in each chamber.

Requires the Working Group to report its recommendations, including any required legislative language, to the House and Senate within three days after their adoption. Prohibits the Working Group from reporting any recommendation that does not receive the support of a majority of its members.

Requires the termination of the Working Group immediately after the transmission of its recommendations.</summary>
