  <description>Amendment sought to strike section 3 of the bill (Keystone XL Permit Approval) which states that the Keystone XL pipeline does not require a permit to cross the international border between Canada and the United States.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 5 printed in House Report 113-88 to strike section 3 of the bill (Keystone XL Permit Approval). Section 3 eliminates the requirement for a Presidential Permit to construct the Keystone XL pipeline across an international border. Section 3 further deems the new application for the Keystone XL pipeline approved, based on a final environmental impact statement issued by the U.S. Department of State for a different pipeline route.</purpose>
