  <description>Amendment strikes section 204 which seeks to limit the ability to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 2 printed in Part B of House Report 113-131 to strike section 204 because it eliminates environmental evaluation typically provided by an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) and because conducting a single multisale EIS for decisions with different timelines creates unnecessary conflicts in the EIS process.</purpose>
