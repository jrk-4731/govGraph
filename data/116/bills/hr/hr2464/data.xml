This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a grant program that supports violence prevention efforts. Specifically, HHS must award grants to trauma centers or nonprofit entities for the purpose of conducting or expanding research on the effectiveness of violence prevention efforts in reducing re-injury and re-incarceration that is caused by intentional violent trauma, excluding intimate partner violence. HHS must also publish best practices for preventing intentional violent trauma based on findings from the grant program.</summary>
