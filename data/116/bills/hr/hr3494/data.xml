  <summary date="2019-06-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020

This bill reauthorizes for FY2020 intelligence activities in various U.S. government departments and agencies. It also establishes several intelligence-related programs and calls for reports on various topics.

The bill establishes a paid parental leave program for intelligence community employees. The program provides 12 weeks of leave in the 12-month period following the birth or adoption of a child.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) shall report on intelligence community policies for awarding contracts, including research and development contracts, involving certain foreign countries. The report shall assess whether security and counterintelligence risks are being properly considered in such policies.

The bill establishes the Climate Security Intelligence Center within the ODNI. The center's duties shall include analyzing climate security (such as climate developments that could substantially affect political stability in a country) and the role of the United States in influencing the climate policies of other countries.

The bill transfers the National Intelligence University from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the ODNI.

The bill requires reports on various issues, including (1) Russia's political leaders, (2) the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, (3) China's influence operations in the United States and Taiwan and its repression of ethnic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, and (4) domestic terrorism in the United States.

The bill also establishes (1) a task force to study the illicit finance of espionage and foreign influence operations in the United States, and (2) a prize to stimulate research in technology to detect fake video or audio created using machine-learning techniques.</summary>
