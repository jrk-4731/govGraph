This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase specified resubmission thresholds for shareholder proposals. (Current regulations allow the resubmission of a shareholder proposal that has been previously included in an issuer's proxy materials if, when the proposal was last included, it received a specified percentage of the vote; this percentage, which&#160;varies&#160;depending upon the number of times a proposal has been previously submitted, represents the minimum threshold at which resubmission is permissible.)</summary>
