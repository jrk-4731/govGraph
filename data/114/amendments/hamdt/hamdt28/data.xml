  <description>Amendment provides flexibility to localities by providing States with the authority to allow local educational agencies to administer their own, locally designed academic assessment systems, in place of the State-designed academic systems. Amendment also provides that the same requirements as laid out by this Act for State-designed academic assessments would also apply to any locally designed academic assessment.</description>
