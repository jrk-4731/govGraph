  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in House Report 114-49 and numbered 6 was offered as a substitute containing changes with respect to increasing the spending level for the global war on terror and removing the requirement for an offset to accomodate such spending increase.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute numbered 6 printed in House Report 114-49 to increase new budget authority for the Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism function (Function 970) by $2 billion, from $94 billion to $96 billion in Fiscal Year 2016. The amendment increases the outlay amounts for OCO over the period of Fiscal Years 2016 to 2025. As a consequence of the increase in OCO/GWOT, conforming increases are made in total budget authority and outlays, deficits, interest, debt subject to limit, and debt held by the public. The amendment also strikes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism in section 513 of the reported resolution.</purpose>
