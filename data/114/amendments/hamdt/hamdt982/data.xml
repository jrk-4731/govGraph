  <description>Amendment sought to stipulate that no sponsor of a demo day can collect finders' fees for connecting investors to companies; sought to limit the relief offered under the bill to actual operating companies in the "real economy"; and sought to codify the relief the SEC has already provided for angel investor groups as it relates to demo days.</description>
