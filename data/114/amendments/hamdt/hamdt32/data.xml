  <description>Amendment restores to the bill the paraprofessional qualifications which are in place under current law.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 9 printed in Part B of House Report 114-29 to restore the paraprofessional qualifications that are in place under current law, which helped stop school districts from hiring paraprofessionals with little experience in education and no professional training. Since all districts are in compliance, and have been since 2006, this amendment would present no new burden.</purpose>
