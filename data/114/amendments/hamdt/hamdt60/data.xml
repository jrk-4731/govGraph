  <description>Amendment ensures that federal education dollars go toward their intended use for student benefit in the classroom by clarifying that funds received under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act shall not be diverted by the States to fill prior unfunded liability shortfalls in teacher pension programs. Amendment also prohibits the state from requiring LEAs to make a contribution to a pension program that is in excess of the "normal cost" of that teacher's participation in the pension program.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment No. 37 printed in part B of House Report 114-29 to ensure that federal education dollars go toward their intended use for student benefit in the classroom by clarifying that funds received under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act shall not be diverted by the states to fill prior unfunded liability shortfalls in teacher pension programs. When a state receives funds under ESEA and distributes those funds to LEAs, the amendment prohibits the state from requiring LEAs to make a contribution to a pension program that is in excess of the "normal cost" of that teacher's participation in the pension program.</purpose>
