  <description>Amendment allows the Army Corps of Engineers to pursue projects and technologies that prevent and mitigate flood damages associated with ice jams (chunks of ice floating on a river that catch on an obstruction such as bridge pilings, rocks, logs, etc., that pile up to form an ice dam, and cause flooding upstream from the blockage, and then possibly downstream again when the ice finally releases).</description>
