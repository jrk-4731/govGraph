Directs the President to develop and submit to Congress a comprehensive diplomatic, political, economic, and regionally led strategy to degrade and dismantle the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Prohibits funds available to the Department of Defense or any other department or agency from being used to deploy U.S. ground forces in a combat role against ISIL.

States that nothing in this resolution shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting any authority of the President: (1) under any provision of law other than the Authorization for Use of Military Force and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002; and (2) to respond to, or to prevent imminent attacks, on the United States, its territorial possessions, its embassies, its consulates, or its Armed Forces abroad, consistent with and limited to the President's constitutional powers and responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief.

Repeals the Authorization for Use of Military Force and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.</summary>
