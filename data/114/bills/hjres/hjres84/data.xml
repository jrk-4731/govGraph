 This joint resolution authorizes the President to use the Armed Forces against the Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Shabab, Boko Haram, Al-Nusrah Front, the Haqqani-Network, the Taliban, Houthi's, Khorasan Group, Hamas, Hezbollah, and any substantial supporters, associated forces, or closely related successor entities.
