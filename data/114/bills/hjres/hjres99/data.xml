  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution provides continuing FY2017 appropriations to federal agencies until the earlier of February 28, 2017, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.

It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted.

The resolution specifies the rates of operations for security and nonsecurity programs. It also includes several provisions that restrict or prohibit the use of funds for specified purposes.</summary>
