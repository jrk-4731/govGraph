  <summary date="2015-05-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Grants congressional consent to the Health Care Compact. Exempts the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration from the Health Care Compact.

(In a member state, the Health Care Compact gives primary responsibility for regulation of health care to the state. Federal and state laws remain in effect in a member state until suspended by the state. A member state is responsible for federal funding obligations that remain in effect in the state. Each year, a member state is entitled to federal funds equal to the total federal spending on health care in the state during FY2010, adjusted for inflation and population. The compact establishes the Interstate Advisory Health Care Commission to collect information and data to assist member states in their regulation of health care. The commission may make non-binding recommendations to the member states.)</summary>
