  <summary date="2015-04-29T15:42:05Z" status="Conference report filed in House">Establishes the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2016 and sets forth budgetary levels for FY2017-FY2025.

TITLE I--RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND AMOUNTS

Subtitle A--Budgetary Levels in Both Houses

(Sec. 1101) Recommends levels and amounts for FY2016-FY2025 for federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and debt held by the public.

(Sec. 1102) Recommends levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2016-FY2025 for each major functional category, including:

 National Defense; International Affairs; General Science, Space, and Technology; Energy; Natural Resources and Environment; Agriculture; Commerce and Housing Credit; Transportation; Community and Regional Development; Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services; Health; Medicare; Income Security; Social Security Retirement and Disability; Veterans Benefits and Services; Administration of Justice; General Government; Net Interest; Allowances; Undistributed Offsetting Receipts; and Overseas Contingency Operations. Subtitle B--Levels and Amounts in the Senate

(Sec. 1201) Recommends Senate levels for FY2016-FY2025 for Social Security revenues, outlays, and administrative expenses.

(Sec. 1202) Recommends Senate levels of new budget authority and outlays for FY2016-FY2025 for U.S. Postal Service discretionary administrative expenses.

TITLE II--RECONCILIATION

(Title II includes reconciliation instructions directing congressional committees to submit deficit reduction legislation to the budget committees. Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)

(Sec. 2001) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to each submit to the Senate Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2016-FY2025 period. Requires the legislation to be submitted by July 24, 2015.

Creates a point of order in the Senate against considering reconciliation legislation, pursuant to Section 2001, that would increase the public debt limit during the period of FY2016-FY2025. Permits the point of order to be waived by a two-thirds vote of the Members duly chosen and sworn.

(Sec. 2002) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the House Education and Workforce Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee to each submit to the House Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2016-FY2025 period. Requires the legislation to be submitted by July 24, 2015.

Requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to use the baseline underlying the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) March 2015 update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2015 to 2025 (January 2015) when estimating the costs of legislation. Permits the chairman to determine whether adjustments to the baseline made after this resolution is adopted should be used. Permits the chairman to revise budgetary levels and allocations to reflect the impact of reconciliation legislation.

Requires the House committees directed to submit reconciliation legislation to determine the most effective methods for repealing the Affordable Care Act.

TITLE III--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT

Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement in Both Houses

(Sec. 3101) Revises the existing Senate point of order against legislation that would increase long-term deficits. Applies the point of order to legislation that would cause a net increase in on-budget deficits in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution. (The existing Senate long-term deficit point of order applies to deficits rather than on-budget deficits.)

Exempts Senate legislation for which the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has made adjustments to the allocations, levels, and limits in this resolution, pursuant to the deficit-neutral reserve fund included in Section 4303(1) for legislation relating to the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Establishes a point of order in the House against legislation with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $5 billion in any of the four consecutive ten-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.

Exempts House legislation for which the chairman of the House Budget Committee has made adjustments to the allocations, levels, or limits contained in this concurrent resolution pursuant to sections 4501, 4502, or 4503, which establish deficit-neutral reserve funds for health care legislation, including the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

(Sec. 3102) Provides the appropriations committees with separate allocations for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and specifies procedures for enforcing and adjusting the allocations.

(Sec. 3103) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) in appropriations legislation for FY2016-FY2019. Limits CHIMPs that reduce budget authority but do not decrease outlays to $19.1 billion for FY2016, $19.1 billion for FY2017, $17 billion for FY2018, and $15 billion for FY2019.

(Sec. 3104) Establishes a point of order against full-year FY2016 appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs that affect the Crime Victims Fund and exceed $10.8 billion for FY2016.

(Sec. 3105) Requires CBO, upon request of the chairman of either the House or Senate Budget Committees to include an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the ''fair value'' of assets and liabilities in estimates for certain federal credit programs under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Requires CBO to provide fair-value estimates for legislation related to a housing, residential mortgage, or student loan program. Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to use the estimates to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budget enforcement controls. Permits the Senate to use the estimates only for informational purposes.

(Sec. 3106) Provides directions regarding the scoring of legislation relating to a transition from the paper dollar to the dollar coin.

(Sec. 3107) Requires CBO to provide estimates of the budgetary effects over FY2016-FY2045 for legislation increasing discretionary spending limits or transferring amounts from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund. (Most CBO estimates are currently provided over a 5- or 10-year period.)

(Sec. 3108) Requires CBO to provide projections of federal revenues, outlays, and deficits for the 30-year period beginning with the budget year in its required annual update to the Budget and Economic Outlook.

(Sec. 3109) Directs CBO to provide estimates of outlay changes during the second and third decade of enactment of legislation if: (1) either of the budget committee chairs requests the estimate, or (2) the legislation has an outlay impact in excess of 0.25% of the U.S. gross domestic product during the first decade or in the tenth year.

(Sec. 3110) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used to determine budgetary impacts for evaluating budget points of order. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.)

(Sec. 3111) Requires CBO to include in deficit projections a one-page statement that: (1) summarizes and categorizes total outlays, receipts, surpluses, and deficits on a unified basis; and (2) includes subtotals for outlays for mandatory and discretionary programs; outlays, payroll tax revenue, and offsetting receipts for Social Security and for Medicare; the surplus or deficit of revenues over outlays for Social Security and Medicare; and revenues.

(Sec. 3112) Directs CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation. In the Senate, the estimates would be provided for informational purposes only.)

Subtitle B--Budget Enforcement in the Senate

(Sec. 3201) Extends procedures in the Senate for waivers and appeals of specified budget points of order with a vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes) through September 30, 2025.

Makes Senate points of order against legislation violating Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules or increasing the short-term deficit permanent. (The PAYGO point of order prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified time periods. The short-term deficit point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.)

(Sec. 3202) Updates the existing point of order against advanced appropriations to conform to the new budget window. (Under the resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2016 that first becomes available after FY2016, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2017 that first becomes available after FY2017. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each fiscal year).

(Sec. 3203) Increases the vote threshold for waiving points of order against legislation with unfunded intergovernmental mandates from a simple majority to three-fifths of Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes).

(Sec. 3204) Repeals the Senate point of order against reconciliation legislation that would increase the deficit or reduce a surplus.

(Sec. 3205) Establishes a Senate point of order against voting on passage of legislation unless the CBO cost estimate was available on CBO's website at least 28 hours before the vote.

(Sec. 3206) Applies to the Senate a House point of order protecting savings in reconciliation legislation from amendments that increase the deficit.

(Sec. 3207) Provides directions to CBO regarding the scoring of certain energy savings contracts.

(Sec. 3208) Authorizes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits included in this resolution if legislation is enacted that permits adjustments to discretionary spending limits to accommodate wildfire suppression funding.

Subtitle C--Budget Enforcement in the House of Representatives

(Sec. 3301) Prohibits the House from considering legislation in FY2016 that reduces the actuarial balance of the Social Security trust funds below specified levels.
