  <summary date="2016-09-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Recognizes that the intent of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 included the presumption that veterans who served in the Armed Forces in the bays, harbors, and territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, were exposed to Agent Orange.

Expresses the intent that such veterans who served in those areas and other areas exposed to Agent Orange who have been diagnosed with connected medical conditions should be equally recognized for such exposure through equitable benefits and coverage.

Calls on the Department of Veterans Affairs to acknowledge such intent, rescind specified parts of the VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M21-1 pertaining to developing claims based on herbicide exposure in Vietnam, and reissue guidance extending presumptive coverage for Agent Orange exposure to such veterans.</summary>
