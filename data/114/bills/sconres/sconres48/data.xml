  <summary date="2016-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of Congress that:

 Italy has violated the principle of reciprocity governing the mutual recognition of domestic court awards between Italy and the United States; the intervention by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of Iran against victims of Iranian terrorism was initiated to the detriment of both United States and European Union terrorism victims; and the European Court of Human Rights should overturn the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation's erroneous rulings in Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran and Eisenfeld v. Islamic Republic of Iran and order such court to recognize the U.S. judgments held by the Flatow, Duker, and Eisenfeld families against Iran.</summary>
