Certain banks may exempt themselves from specified regulatory standards if they maintain a certain ratio of capital to total assets and meet other specified requirements.\n\nThe bill removes the Financial Stability Oversight Council's authority to designate non-bank financial institutions and financial market utilities as \"systemically important\" (also known as \"too big to fail\").\u00a0Under current law,\u00a0entities so designated are subject to additional regulatory restrictions.\u00a0Designations made previously are retroactively repealed.\u00a0\n\nThe bill also amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to:\n\n restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by replacing its director with a bipartisan commission; subject\u00a0the commission\u00a0to the congressional appropriations process, expanded judicial review, and additional congressional oversight; and limit the commission's authority to\u00a0take action against entities for \"abusive\" practices. In addition, the bill:\n\n modifies provisions related to the Securities and Exchange Commission's managerial structure and enforcement authority; eliminates the Office of Financial Research within the Department of the Treasury; and revises\u00a0provisions related to capital formation, insurance regulation, civil penalties for securities laws violations, and community financial institutions."
