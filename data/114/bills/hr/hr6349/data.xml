Any individual casting a ballot in a general election for federal office shall be given the opportunity to cast a vote for "None of the Above" on a separate line after the names of all other candidates in the election.

The effect of "None of the Above" receiving the greatest number of votes in elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate would be to require a special election and in elections for President and Vice President it would be to require a special general election.</summary>
