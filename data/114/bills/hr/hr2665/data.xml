 Designates certain federal land in the Olympic National Forest in the state of Washington as wilderness and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Designates certain other land, identified on the same map as such proposed areas, as potential wilderness.

 Elwha River; Dungeness River; Big Quilcene River; Dosewallips River; Duckabush River; Hamma Hamma River; South Fork Skokomish River; Middle Fork Satsop River; West Fork Satsop River; Wynoochee River; East Fork Humptulips River; West Fork Humptulips River; Quinault River; Queets River; Hoh River; Bogachiel River; South Fork Calawah River; Sol Duc River; and Lyre River. Authorizes the Department of Agriculture to take necessary measures to control fire, insects, and diseases in the wilderness areas designated by this Act.
