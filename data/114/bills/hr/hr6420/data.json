The FAA shall separately study and report on:\n\n the cost and feasibility of retrofitting advanced image technology screening equipment to distinguish between foreign objects and human body parts; and the disparate impact that such technology has on self-identified transgender passengers as opposed to the general public, including an examination of instances since 2010 in which such passengers were required to undergo a secondary screening after alarming the advanced imaging technology."
