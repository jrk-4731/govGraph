This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to:

 develop procedures to appropriately screen self-identified transgender air passengers, and conduct in-person training of all Transportation Security Administration Officers on such procedures. The FAA shall separately study and report on:

 the cost and feasibility of retrofitting advanced image technology screening equipment to distinguish between foreign objects and human body parts; and the disparate impact that such technology has on self-identified transgender passengers as opposed to the general public, including an examination of instances since 2010 in which such passengers were required to undergo a secondary screening after alarming the advanced imaging technology.</summary>
