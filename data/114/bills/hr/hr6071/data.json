    "text": "This bill provides continuing FY2017 appropriations to most federal agencies until the earlier of December 9, 2016, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.\n\n It prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because the FY2017 appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted. The bill specifies the rates of operations for security and nonsecurity programs for the duration of the continuing appropriations.\n\nThe bill enacts, by reference, the provisions of the conference report for H.R. 2577 (Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 and Zika Response and Preparedness Act).\n\nAmerican Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 or the American SAFE Act of 2015 \n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence must take specified actions to ensure that certain aliens from Iraq or Syria receive thorough background investigations and are certified not to be a security threat prior to being admitted to the United States as refugees.\n\nProtecting Internet Freedom Act \n\nThe Department of Commerce may not allow the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions to cease unless a federal statute enacted after enactment of this bill expressly grants Commerce the authority.\n\nCommerce must certify to Congress that the United States: (1) secured sole ownership of the .gov and .mil top-level domains, and (2) entered into a contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers that provides the U.S. government with exclusive control and use of those domains in perpetuity."
