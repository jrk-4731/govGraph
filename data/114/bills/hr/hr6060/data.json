The court must render judgement without regard to defenses based on the passage of time, including the statute of limitations. The United States is the only entity liable for such a claim and monetary damages are the only available remedy. This jurisdiction expires unless such a claim is filed within one year of enactment of this bill.\n\nAll other claims of the tribe to title arising under the Treaty of Grouseland are extinguished."
