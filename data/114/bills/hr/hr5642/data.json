Additionally, this bill amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition on transferring a firearm knowing that the firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Specifically, it broadens the scope of the prohibition to bar the transfer or receipt of a firearm knowing or reasonably believing that the firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence, a drug trafficking crime, or a federal crime of terrorism. It increases from 10 to 15 years the maximum prison term for a violator."
