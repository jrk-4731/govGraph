  <summary date="2016-07-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Counterterrorism Enhancement Act of 2016

This bill authorizes additional FY2017 appropriations to the Department of Justice for:

 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for personnel, training, and equipment to counter terrorism; the Bureau of Justice Programs, for a Violence Against Law Enforcement Officer Resilience and Survivability (i.e., VALOR) initiative; the Civil Rights Division; and the Community Relations Service. Additionally, this bill amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition on transferring a firearm knowing that the firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Specifically, it broadens the scope of the prohibition to bar the transfer or receipt of a firearm knowing or reasonably believing that the firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence, a drug trafficking crime, or a federal crime of terrorism. It increases from 10 to 15 years the maximum prison term for a violator.</summary>
