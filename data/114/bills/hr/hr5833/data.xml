This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation that addresses lead in drinking water in schools and day care facilities. The EPA must also establish a grant program for: (1) testing such drinking water for lead contamination, and (2) replacing lead pipes and certain plumbing materials with lead-free material.</summary>
