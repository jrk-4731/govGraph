  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">The document titled "Dependent Re-Survey, Extension Survey and Survey of Two Islands, Sections 17, 29, and 30" (completed on November 24, 1967; approved on January 15, 1969; and filed in the Federal Register), relating to a plat of a survey of such sections of land, including Peggys and Hog Islands, surrounding Lake Bistineau in Louisiana, shall not be considered or serve as a gross error determination and otherwise shall have no legal force or effect on the ownership of those lands and islands.

The meander lines in the Original Survey of December 8, 1842, for such land and adjacent islands (which were not included in such survey) are definitive for the purposes of determining title to them.

The Department of the Interior shall prepare a recordable disclaimer of interest in the omitted lands, if any, including land descriptions, by using the lot or tract numbers as shown on the Dependent Re-Survey, and lands lying outside the record meander lines.</summary>
