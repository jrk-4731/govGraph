DHS must ensure that the system:\n\n incorporates redundant and diverse modes to disseminate warning messages to reach the greatest number of individuals in the intended area; can be adapted to incorporate emerging and future technologies; is reliable, resilient, and secure and can withstand acts of terrorism, hazards, and other external attacks or dangers; is hardened against cyber attacks; promotes state, local, tribal, and regional partnerships to enhance coordination; and is designed to provide alerts that are accessible to the largest portion of the affected population and to improve the ability of those in remote areas and areas with underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure to receive alerts. DHS must: (1) produce a Privacy Impact Assessment every five years to evaluate whether the technology of the system has implications on the privacy rights of U.S. citizens; (2) establish the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Advisory Committee; and (3) make available to the public a list of mobile devices capable of receiving warnings and alerts disseminated through such system.\n\nThe Advisory Committee shall terminate six years after the date on which it is established.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency must permit the use of homeland security grant funds to improve public alert and warning capabilities."
