This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify fire safety reporting requirements for an institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs.

Specifically, it requires an IHE that maintains on-campus student housing facilities to notify students about whether a housing facility is equipped with a fire safety system, including an automatic fire sprinkler system in each bedroom.

Additionally, the bill expands the information an IHE must submit in its annual fire safety report to include, with respect to student housing facilities, the number and percentage of beds protected and not protected by an automatic fire sprinkler system in the bedroom.

Finally, the Department of Education must publish the number and percentage, in the aggregate and by state, of:

 student housing facilities with less than 100% of beds protected by an automatic sprinkler system, student housing facilities with less than 50% of beds protected, beds at student housing facilities that are protected, and beds at student housing facilities that are not protected.</summary>
