This bill amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to revise and expand the definition of the term "consumer financial product or service" to include terminable lease or bailment of personal property contracts (rent-to-own transactions) (other than a lease or bailment of a motor vehicle) for use by the consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes under which:

 a consumer has the right of possession and use of the property, as well as the option to periodically renew the contract by making payments; and a seller agrees to transfer property ownership to the consumer upon the fulfillment of all contract obligations of the consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau shall:

 prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with such contracts; and issue regulations identifying methods to protect consumers from entering into them.</summary>
