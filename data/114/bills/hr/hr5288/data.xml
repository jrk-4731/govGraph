  <summary date="2016-05-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Consortia-Led Energy and Advanced Manufacturing Networks Act

This bill requires the Department of Commerce to carry out a grant program for establishing consortia to enhance U.S. economic, environmental, and energy security by promoting domestic research, development, manufacture, and deployment of clean technologies and advanced manufacturing processes. Clean technology means technologies, production processes, or methodologies that:

 produce energy from renewable energy sources; transmit, distribute, or store energy more efficiently; enhance energy efficiency for buildings and industry; enable the development of a Smart Grid (an evolving electric power network that utilizes new information technology systems, including those that enable customers to reduce or shift their power use during peak demand periods); produce an advanced or sustainable material with energy or energy efficiency applications; improve energy efficiency for transportation; or enhance water security through improved water management, conservation, distribution, or end use applications.</summary>
