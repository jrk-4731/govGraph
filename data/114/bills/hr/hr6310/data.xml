 This bill eliminates the minimum continuous active duty service requirement for homeless veterans to receive certain benefits, including: (1) outreach, (2) rehabilitative services, (3) vocational counseling and training, (4) transitional housing assistance, (5) supportive services for very low-income veteran families in permanent housing, and (6) health care for homeless veterans with special needs.

Homeless veterans are exempted from disqualification for such benefits because of discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under conditions other than honorable, except for discharge by reason of a general court-martial.

"Veteran" is defined for purposes of such benefits as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, regardless of length of service and who was discharged or released from service other than by a dishonorable discharge or by reason of a general court-martial.

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shall conduct related training and education for appropriate VA and grant recipient personnel.

Services for which a homeless veteran receives a grant under the VA comprehensive service programs for homeless veterans may include furnishing care for a dependent under the veteran's care.</summary>
