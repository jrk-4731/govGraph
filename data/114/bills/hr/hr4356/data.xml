This bill amends the federal criminal code to authorize the Department of Justice (DOJ) to inspect or examine the inventory and records of a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of firearms to ensure compliance with recordkeeping requirements not more than three times a year (currently, not more than once a year) without reasonable cause and a warrant. It authorizes the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to hire at least 50 additional personnel to carry out the additional inspections.

It increases to five years the term of imprisonment for knowingly making a false statement or representation in required firearms records. It authorizes up to 10 years' imprisonment for: (1) providing false statements or identification related to the sale or other disposition of a firearm or ammunition, or (2) selling or otherwise disposing of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person is prohibited from possessing a firearm.

The bill authorizes DOJ to suspend a firearms license or subject a licensee to a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for willfully violating firearms requirements or failing to have secure storage or safety devices available at any place firearms are sold to non-licensees (current law authorizes only license revocation).

It permits a licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector who is indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to continue to operate under the license until the date of any conviction pursuant to the indictment (currently, until any conviction pursuant to the indictment becomes final).</summary>
