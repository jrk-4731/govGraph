  <summary date="2016-03-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Tuition Use Information Transparently Identified Online Act or the TUITION Act

This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand disclosure requirements for an institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student aid programs.

Specifically, it requires an IHE to publish annually on its website for students and parents: (1) the total revenue it generated from tuition and fees, disaggregated by the proportion of such revenue it applied to any type of institutional expense (e.g., faculty salaries); and (2) a description of each such expense. 

This requirement takes effect in academic year 2016-2017.</summary>
