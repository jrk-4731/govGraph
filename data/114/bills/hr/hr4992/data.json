The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nUnited States Financial System Protection Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 3) This bill applies to transfers of funds to or from Iran, or for the direct or indirect benefit of an Iranian person or the government of Iran, for a specified period only, the existing authorization for U.S. depository institutions and registered brokers or dealers in securities to process such a funds transfer if the transfer arises from, and is ordinarily incident and necessary to give effect to, an underlying transaction that has been authorized by a specific or general license and does not involve debiting or crediting an Iranian account.\n\nThe period of application shall be from on or after January 1, 2016, until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of Iran has ceased:\n\n supporting acts of international terrorism; and developing nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles and ballistic missile launch technology (and has dismantled existing ones). The requirements of this bill shall also apply to foreign financial institutions and registered brokers or dealers in securities if the funds to be transferred are denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe President may not, except for certain humanitarian purposes, issue any license under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or take other action that permits a domestic or foreign depository institution or registered broker or dealer in securities to conduct an offshore U.S. dollar clearing system, or supply U.S. dollars for any such system conducted or overseen by a foreign government or financial institution, for transactions (including funds transfers) involving or for the benefit of the government of Iran or an Iranian person.\n\n (Sec. 4) The President may not rescind a preliminary draft rule or final rule authorizing designation of Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern without first certifying to Congress that the government of Iran is no longer engaged in support for terrorism, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and any illicit and deceptive financial activities."
