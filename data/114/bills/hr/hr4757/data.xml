  <summary date="2016-11-29T15:30:32Z" status="Passed House amended">(Sec. 1) This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to furnish at a private cemetery, and upon request, a headstone, marker, or medallion that signifies the status of an eligible veteran who served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917, as a Medal of Honor recipient.

If the VA furnished a headstone, marker, or medallion for a deceased veteran that does not signify his or her status as a Medal of Honor recipient, the VA shall upon request replace that headstone, marker, or medallion with one that signifies the deceased's status as a Medal of Honor recipient.

(Sec. 2) The bill authorizes award of the Presidential Memorial Certificate to certain deceased members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, the Air or Army National Guard, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.</summary>
