    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nHighlights: \n\nThe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 provides annual appropriations for:\n\n the Department of Labor; most of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Department of Education (ED); and several related agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the National Labor Relations Board. The bill does not include funding for the Food and Drug Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which are included within HHS, but considered in other appropriations bills.\n\nThe bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The majority of the funding in the bill is mandatory funding for entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income that are funded in annual appropriations bills. These programs, known as appropriated entitlements, are included in annual appropriations bills, though the amounts provided for the programs are generally determined by authorizing statutes that control details of the programs such as eligibility rules and benefit levels.\n\nThe bill decreases discretionary funding compared to FY2016 levels. It also includes provisions that affect polices in areas such as:\n\n implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, abortion, human embryo research, the use of federal facilities for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments, fiduciary standards for providing investment advice for pension and retirement plans, collective bargaining, needle exchange programs, and withholding financial assistance to educational institutions for violations of the civil rights of transgender students. The bill also restricts funding for Department of Education regulations to define gainful employment, establish requirements for the state authorization of higher education programs, define credit hours, and establish a teacher preparation program accountability system.\n\nFull Summary: \n\nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017\n\nProvides FY2017 appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and several related agencies.\n\nDepartment of Labor Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nTITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF LABOR\n\nProvides FY2017 appropriations for agencies and programs within the Department of Labor.\n\nProvides appropriations to the Employment and Training Administration for:\n\n Training and Employment Services, the Job Corps, Community Service Employment for Older Americans, Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances, State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations, Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds, and Program Administration.
