This bill requires a state that receives funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to certify within one year that its state laws do not impose a time limit (e.g., statute of limitation) on the criminal prosecution of certain sexual assault offenses.

The Department of Justice must reduce by 20% the JAG allocation of a state that fails to submit this certification.</summary>
