Construction Authorization and Choice Improvement Act

(Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out the replacement of the existing VA Medical Center in Denver, Colorado, in FY2015 in an amount not to exceed $900 million.

(Sec. 3) The 40-mile distance requirement for a veteran to use a non-VA medical facility under the veterans choice program of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 shall be construed to allow a veteran to access a non-VA medical facility if:

 the veteran resides more than 40 miles driving distance from the closest VA facility; or the veteran faces an unusual or excessive burden in traveling to such VA medical facility not only because of geographical challenges (as under current law) but also because of environmental factors, such as roads that are not accessible to the general public, traffic, or hazardous weather, because of a medical condition that impacts the ability to travel, or because of other factors as the Secretary determines.</summary>
