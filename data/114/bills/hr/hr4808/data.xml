This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify the Federal Pell Grant program.

Specifically, if a Pell Grant recipient fails to complete an education program within the maximum timeframe for completion, then the Pell Grants received for such program convert to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan and are subject to repayment, in accordance with applicable terms and conditions.</summary>
