Overtime Pay for Protective Services Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill temporarily exempts U.S. Secret Service officers, employees, or agents from limitations on their receipt of premium pay (i.e., overtime pay) for their performance of protective services for individuals or events during 2016. Under current law, the aggregate of their basic pay and premium pay may not exceed the greater of: (1) the maximum basic pay for the GS-15 pay level for federal employees, or (2) the rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule.

If the exemption results in the payment of additional premium pay of a type that is normally creditable as basic pay for retirement or any other purpose, that additional pay shall not be: (1) considered to be basic pay, or (2) used in computing a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave.

The payment of additional premium pay under this bill shall also not be counted as part of a Secret Service employee's aggregate compensation for purposes of the annual limits on allowances, bonuses, awards, or other similar cash payments.

The bill applies retroactively as if it was enacted on December 31, 2015.</summary>
