 This bill amends the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) to revise the Department of Transportation (DOT) TIFIA program of direct loans, loan guarantees, and credit for surface transportation projects.

A TIFIA Revolving Fund is established in the Treasury.

A set-aside of up to 10% of Fund amounts is required for rural infrastructure projects (as similarly required in current funding law).

The DOT is directed to transfer from the Fund to the general fund of the Treasury amounts equal to moneys deposited in the Fund as a result of the repayment of principal and interest on direct loans for transportation infrastructure projects before enactment of this Act.

Project eligibility requirements are revised.</summary>
