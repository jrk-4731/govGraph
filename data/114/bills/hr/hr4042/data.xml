This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to award high-quality prekindergarten (pre-K) program development grants on a competitive basis to states, local education agencies, or other local government entities.

A grant recipient may use the grant funds to award subgrants to local entities, provided that the entity did not receive pre-K program&#160;funding within the same fiscal year.

Grants are nonrenewable and shall be awarded for a period of no more than three years.

Unless granted a financial hardship waiver by ED,&#160;a grant recipient shall contribute matching funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount.</summary>
