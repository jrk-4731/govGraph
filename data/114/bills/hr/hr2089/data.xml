 This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to up to 10 institutions of higher education (IHEs) to conduct pilot programs to reduce the cost of attendance for undergraduate students by expanding their access to digital course materials.

A preference is given to applications that demonstrate a commitment to serving disadvantaged students.

Grantees must make digital course materials available to undergraduate students in at least two different academic departments.

Grant funds may be used to:

 purchase and maintain the electronic equipment or software their pilot programs need; purchase and maintain the digital and online content that instructors or students will use; hire staff to administer their pilot programs, with priority given to hiring enrolled undergraduate students; build or acquire extra storage space for pilot program equipment; support professional development; and revise and adapt curricula as needed to implement the IHEs' pilot programs.</summary>
