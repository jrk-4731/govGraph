The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall award distracted driving grants to states that enact and enforce a statute that:

 prohibits a driver from using a hand-held personal wireless communications device (such as a cell phone or smart phone) to call while driving, allows the use of a hands-free device by a driver (other than under age 18) to call, makes violation of the law a primary offense, and establishes certain minimum penalties for first violations and increased penalties for repeat violations. The DOT shall establish a research program to study distracted driving by motor vehicle drivers.

The Federal Communications Commission shall report to Congress on existing and developing wireless communications technology that may be used to reduce problems associated with distracted driving.</summary>
