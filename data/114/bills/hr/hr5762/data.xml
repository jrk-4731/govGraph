This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1)&#160;establish, within the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, a separate Hazardous Liquids Rail Spill Liability Account to support actions related to preventing and responding to discharges of oil or hazardous substances&#160;that result&#160;from rail shipments;&#160;(2) impose a fee on hazardous flammable liquids transported by rail; and (3) establish a tax credit for qualified tank-car conversion expenses.

In addition, the bill:

 expands liability with respect to discharges of hazardous substances, expands Department of Transportation (DOT) training&#160;with respect&#160;to&#160;accidents arising from&#160;rail transportation of flammable&#160;liquids or gases, establishes a High Hazard Rail Shipments Preparedness grant program, and establishes a Track Relocation and Railroad Inspection Safety grant program.
