Highlights:

This bill provides FY2017 appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA), except for the Forest Service which is included in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.

It also provides appropriations for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Farm Credit Administration.

The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The mandatory funding levels are generally set by authorizing legislation such as the farm bill and are frequently limited in the agriculture appropriations bill.

The bill decreases discretionary funding for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies below FY2016 levels.

Compared to FY2016 levels, the bill increases discretionary funding for:

 Conservation Programs, Rural Development, Domestic Food Programs, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs, and the FDA. The bill decreases discretionary funding for Agricultural Programs and funds both the CFTC and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) at the FY2016 levels.

Also included in the bill are provisions that affect policies in areas such as:

 regulation of newly deemed tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and cigars, reporting requirements for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) households, inventory requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers, nutrition standards for school meals, menu labeling requirements, horse slaughter facility inspections, and livestock and poultry marketing rules.
