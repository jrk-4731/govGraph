(Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State to:

 develop open-source software based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection's global travel targeting and analysis systems and the State Department's watch listing, identification, and screening systems to facilitate the vetting of travelers against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases, enhance border management, and improve targeting and analysis; and make such software and any related technical assistance or training available to foreign governments or multilateral organizations for such purposes. DHS and the State Department shall submit an implementing plan to Congress.

Before making open-source software available to foreign governments or multilateral organizations, DHS and the State Department shall: (1) certify to Congress that such availability is in U.S. national security interests, and (2) inform Congress on how such software or any related technical assistance or training will be made available.

 No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act.</summary>
