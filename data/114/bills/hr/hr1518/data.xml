Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to allow the use of contributions or donations only for the six years following the most recent federal election for a six-year office (i.e., election to the Senate) in which an individual was a candidate for the office if that individual is not a candidate for that office during those ensuing six years.

Requires contributions or donations remaining available to to such an individual after such six-year period ends to be disposed of within 30 days, as follows: (1) to pay any debts or obligations owed in connection with the campaign for that office; (2) to return those contributions or donations to the individuals, entities, or both, who made them; (3) to make contributions to a charitable organization; and (4) to make transfers to a national, state or local committee of a political party.</summary>
