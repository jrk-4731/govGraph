  <summary date="2015-07-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">National Icebreaker Fund Act of 2015

This bill establishes the National Icebreaker Fund, which shall be available for obligation and expenditure only for construction, alteration, renovation, and the lease or charter of icebreakers for the Coast Guard.

There shall be deposited into the Fund: (1) all funds appropriated to any federal agency for construction, alteration, renovation, or the lease or charter of icebreakers; and (2) all receipts from the disposition of icebreakers by the federal government.

Amounts in the Fund may not be used to: (1) lease, charter, construct, alter, renovate, or otherwise acquire any vessel built in a shipyard located in a foreign country, unless specifically authorized by law; or (2) construct, alter, or renovate a vessel in any shipyard other than a U.S. shipyard.

Amounts in the Fund may be expended for: (1) the lease, charter, construction, alteration, or renovation of icebreakers capable of search and rescue, saving of life at sea, maritime safety and security, drug and migrant interdiction, fisheries law enforcement, and environmental response in the Arctic; and (2) additional capabilities that are necessary to carry out national defense missions or for missions related to research and resupply in the Antarctic.

The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall enter into an agreement with nations that operate facilities in Antarctica to establish a mechanism to provide icebreaking services necessary to supply those facilities by constructing, leasing or chartering, renovating, operating, or maintaining an icebreaker.</summary>
