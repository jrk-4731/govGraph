  <summary date="2015-05-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2015

This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require all foreign medical schools to meet minimum requirements for percentage of foreign students and for percentage of students passing exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in order for students to be eligible for William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans. (Currently, the Department of Education may establish alternative standards and certain clinical training programs are grandfathered.)

Students continue to be eligible for a loan if, on the date of enactment of this Act, they are enrolled in a foreign medical school that loses eligibility as a result of this Act.</summary>
