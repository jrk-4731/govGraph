TITLE I--GRANTS, TRAINING, EXERCISES, AND COORDINATION

(Sec. 101) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to enter into memoranda of understanding with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Office of Emergency Communications (OEC), the Office for State and Local Law Enforcement, the Countering Violent Extremism Coordinator, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offices and components to delineate their responsibilities for awarding grants to:

 public transportation agencies to improve security under the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; high-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to protect against terrorism under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP); and port authorities, facility operators, and state and local governments to implement Area Maritime Transportation Security Plans and facility security plans, provide port security services, and train law enforcement personnel. (Sec. 102) The grant funds must be made available for use by the recipients for at least 36 months.

(Sec. 103) Operation Stonegarden is established in DHS for FEMA to enhance border security by making grants to law enforcement agencies involved in CBP operations in states that border Canada or Mexico or that have a maritime border.

(Sec. 105) FEMA must summarize in the annual notice of funding opportunity for UASI and SHSGP grants the DHS Inspector General's findings in audits of such grants and methods to address areas identified for improvement and innovative practices instituted by grant recipients.

(Sec. 106) State planning committees or urban working groups required to assist in the determination of funding priorities under the UASI and the SHSGP must include: (1) public health officials and medical practitioners, (2) educational institutions, and (3) appropriate state and regional interoperable communications coordinators and state and major urban area fusion centers.

(Sec. 107) DHS is prohibited from implementing the National Preparedness Grant Program without congressional authorization.

(Sec. 108) FEMA must coordinate with DHS's Office of Policy, and outreach to relevant stakeholder organizations, when it makes determinations regarding the use of UASI and SHSGP funds for law enforcement terrorism prevention activities.

(Sec. 109) FEMA must permit grant recipients under the UASI and the SHSGP to use grant funds to prepare for terrorism by enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities, including an initial pharmaceutical stockpile with medical kits and diagnostics to protect first responders, their families, immediate victims, and vulnerable populations from a chemical or biological event. Such work may be carried out in conjunction with Department of Energy-owned national laboratories.

(Sec. 110) Applicants for UASI and SHSGP grants seeking funds to purchase equipment must develop equipment maintenance plans that identify which entity is responsible for maintaining such equipment.

(Sec. 111) The bill reauthorizes members of the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium for FY2016-FY2017.

(Sec. 112) DHS is authorized to establish a Rural Domestic Preparedness Consortium of universities and nonprofit organizations to provide training to emergency response providers from rural communities.

(Sec. 113) At least every five years, FEMA must update, and the National Integration Center must review and revise as appropriate, the National Response Plan to consolidate and coordinate the federal government's existing emergency response plans.

FEMA must provide performance metrics to federal agencies with responsibilities under the National Response Framework.

(Sec. 114) The National Integration Center must also review the national incident management system at least every five years.

(Sec. 115) FEMA must develop a uniform process for reviewing applications to use UASI or SHSGP grants to purchase equipment or systems not included on FEMA's authorized equipment list.

(Sec. 204) The OEC must update at least every five years the National Emergency Communications Plan, which must be expanded to consider the impact of emerging technologies on the attainment of interoperable emergency communications.

(Sec. 206) The National Protection and Programs Directorate must submit to Congress information on DHS's responsibilities related to the development of the nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network, including information on efforts to work with the Department of Commerce's First Responder Network Authority to identify and address cyber risks that could impact the network's availability and operations.

(Sec. 207) A state must include in its application for SHSGP funding a certification that: (1) confirms that its governor has designated a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator, or (2) identifies another individual who will be the primary point of contact for performance of such functions.

The Coordinator must:

 coordinate the daily operations of the state's interoperability efforts; coordinate state interoperability and communications projects and grant applications for such projects; establish and maintain working groups to develop and implement key interoperability initiatives; and coordinate and update a Statewide Communications Interoperability Plan that specifies the current status of state efforts to enhance communications interoperability within the state, including future goals for communications interoperability among emergency response agencies in the state. (Sec. 208) DHS's Management Directorate must develop a mechanism to verify that DHS radio users receive ongoing training, including on interagency radio use protocols.

TITLE III--MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS

(Sec. 301) DHS must coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for the purpose of domestic preparedness for and collective response to terrorism, to: (1) establish a program to provide surplus anthrax vaccines nearing the end of their labeled dates of use from the strategic national stockpile for administration to emergency response providers who are at high risk of exposure to anthrax and who voluntarily consent to such administration, (2) distribute disclosures regarding associated benefits and risks to end users, and (3) conduct outreach to educate emergency response providers about the program.

DHS must: (1) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and assessments of the threats posed by anthrax from an act of terror; (2) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to an anthrax terror attack; and (3) share information and provide tailored analytical support on threats posed by anthrax to state, local, and tribal authorities, as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders.

In coordination with HHS, DHS must carry out a 24-month pilot program to provide anthrax vaccines to emergency response providers.

TITLE V--FLOOD INSURANCE CLAIMS PROCESS REFORMS

(Sec. 501) This title amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to direct FEMA to set forth requirements concerning the final engineering report of an engineer or any report of a claims adjustor for any on-site inspection of a property to assess a claim for losses covered by a flood insurance policy under such Act. Such a report:

 may not be transmitted to any other person, employer, agency, or entity, before it is transmitted to the insured; may not include alterations by, or at the request of, anyone other than the person responsible for the final engineering report or the preparer of the claims adjustor report, and shall include a certification that it does not contain any such alterations; and shall provide reasonable assurance that it was transmitted directly to the insured by such person or preparer. For engineering reports, these requirements apply only to the final signed or sealed report that contains final conclusions. But for claims adjustor reports, the requirements apply to any document in connection with such claim that is based on the adjustor's on-site inspection, including any adjustment reports, field reports, drafts, preliminary versions, copies, amendments, or additions.

If FEMA or an insurance company disallows a flood insurance claim, or if the claimant refuses to accept the allowed amount, the claimant may institute a court action against FEMA or the insurance company: (1) within two years after the occurrence of the losses involved in such claim; or (2) in the case of a denial of a claim that is appealed to FEMA, within 90 days after the final determination upon appeal denying such claim in whole or in part, or within two years after the loss, whichever is later. (These time periods replace current law that allows a claimant to institute such an action against FEMA or the insurance company within one year after the mailing of notice of disallowance or partial disallowance.)</summary>
