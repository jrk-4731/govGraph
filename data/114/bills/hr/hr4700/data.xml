  <summary date="2016-03-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Merrill's Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act

This bill directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to arrange for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design to the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), commonly known as Merrill's Marauders, in recognition of their bravery and outstanding service in the jungles of Burma during World War II.

Following its award the gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution where it will be displayed and made available for research.

It is the sense of Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal received under this Act available for display elsewhere, particularly at other locations and events associated with Merrill's Marauders.</summary>
