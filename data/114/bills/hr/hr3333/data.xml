This bill amends the federal criminal code to entitle each prisoner confined in a penal or correctional institution for a definite term other than for life, whose record of conduct shows that the prisoner has substantially observed all Bureau of Prisons regulations and has not been subjected to punishment, to a deduction from his or her sentence of between 5 days and 10 days for each month of such sentence, depending on the sentence length.

The bill also authorizes a sentence reduction, in addition to any commutation of time for good conduct, of up to three days for each month of actual employment in an industry or camp for any part or the first year and up to five days for each month of any part of a succeeding year. The Bureau may also allow such reduction for a prisoner performing exceptionally meritorious service or duties of outstanding importance in connection with institutional operations.

If, during the term of imprisonment, a prisoner commits any offense or violates Bureau regulations, all or any part of his or her earned good time may be forfeited. The Bureau shall provide the criteria and means for restoration of any forfeited or lost good time.</summary>
