Specifically, the bill: (1) eliminates the federal cap on passenger facility charges (local user fees) of $4.50 per enplanement; and (2) with respect to airports that increase such charges beyond $4.50 per enplanement, provides for corresponding reductions in program grant funding.\n\nIn addition, the bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the federal airline ticket tax."
