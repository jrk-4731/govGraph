 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to revise and reauthorize through FY2022 the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program.

It subjects JABG grants to accountability measures. The Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Office of Inspector General must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients. DOJ must submit an annual certification to Congress and identify and report on duplicative grant awards.

(Sec. 3) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the use of best practices is encouraged for activities carried out with JABG funds.

(Sec. 4) DOJ must use amounts made available for general administration to carry out the JABG Program.</summary>
