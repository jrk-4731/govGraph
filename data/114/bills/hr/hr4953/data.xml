 This bill prohibits placing a federal employee on administrative leave, or any other paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for more than 30 consecutive days for reasons relating to misconduct or performance.

In the case of an employee placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, an agency may grant an extension of administrative leave for additional periods of up to 30 consecutive days each if the office investigating the employee submits a report to Congress and the agency certifying that additional time is needed.</summary>
