This bill amends the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) to establish additional grants for the purpose of assisting&#160;states in addressing the needs of high-need children with disabilities. The bill establishes limitations on grant amounts and how grant funds may be used.

To be eligible to receive such a grant, a state shall: (1) provide matching funds equal to at least 25% of the grant amount; and (2) provide any information that the Department of Education may require, as specified by the bill.

A state may request a waiver of certain grant requirements that are incompatible with aspects of the state's governmental structure.</summary>
