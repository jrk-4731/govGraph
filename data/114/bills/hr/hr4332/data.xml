Maximizing Small Business Competition Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Small Business Act to authorize a procurement center representative to review any solicitation for a contract or task order without regard to whether:

 it is set aside for small businesses, one or more contract or task order awards are reserved for small businesses under a multiple award contract, or the solicitation would or would not result in a bundled or consolidated contract or a bundled or consolidated task order.</summary>
