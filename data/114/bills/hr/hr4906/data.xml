This bill allows otherwise eligible employees of a land management agency serving under a time-limited appointment in the competitive service to compete for a permanent appointment in the competitive service: (1) at such agency when the agency is accepting applications from individuals within the agency's workforce under merit promotion procedures, or (2) at any agency when the agency is accepting applications from individuals outside its own workforce under its merit promotion procedures.
