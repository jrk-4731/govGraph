This bill amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit a state from providing a voter, in a federal election, with the opportunity to indicate the selection of a political party as a representation of the selection of an individual candidate. (Thus prohibits voting for a party instead of an individual or "straight-party voting.")</summary>
