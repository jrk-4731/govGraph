The EPA must establish a grant program for repairing, replacing, or upgrading septic tanks and drainage fields.\n\nThe bill revises requirements concerning the clean water state revolving fund (SRF) and the drinking water SRF.\n\nThe bill revises the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring the EPA to establish a program to make grants to local educational agencies for: (1) installing, repairing, or replacing the infrastructure necessary for drinking water coolers, drinking water fountains, or bottle filling station; and (2) testing the quality of drinking water at schools in such local education agency."
