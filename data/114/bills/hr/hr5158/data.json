Such corporations may also elect to repatriate their current and accumulated foreign earnings at a 5% tax rate.\n\nThe bill amends title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to increase the primary insurance amount (the retirement benefit a social security recipient would receive if benefits are taken at normal retirement age) of employees for whom additional social security contributions are made under this bill."
