The placed-in-service sunset date of January 1, 2021, does not apply to the allocations of unutilized national megawatt capacity.\n\nQualified public entities may transfer the credit to an eligible project partner. A \"qualified public entity\" is: (1) a federal, state, or local government or any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof; (2) a mutual or cooperative electric company; or (3) a not-for-profit electric utility which has or had received a loan or loan guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.\n\nAn \"eligible project partner\" includes any person who: (1) is responsible for, or is participating in, the design or construction of the facility; (2) participates in the provision of nuclear steam or nuclear fuel to the facility, or (3) has an ownership interest in the facility."
