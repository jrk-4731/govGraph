This bill prohibits employers from: (1) requiring or requesting that employees or applicants for employment provide their passwords or any other means for accessing their private email accounts or personal online accounts, including social networking websites; or (2) discharging, disciplining, discriminating against, denying employment or promotion to, or threatening to take any such action against employees or applicants who refuse to provide such information, file a complaint or institute a proceeding under this bill, or testify in any such proceeding.

Employers who violate these prohibitions are subject to: (1) civil penalties; (2) the authority of the Department of Labor to bring injunctive actions; and (3) the jurisdiction of U.S. district courts to provide legal or equitable relief including employment, reinstatement, promotion, and payment of lost wages and benefits.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 are amended to prohibit certain institutions of higher education and local educational agencies from requesting such password or account information from students or potential students. The bill prohibits denial of admission, suspension, expulsion, and other discipline or discrimination against students who decline to provide such information, file a complaint, institute a proceeding, or testify in any related proceeding.</summary>
