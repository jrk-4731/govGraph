This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to waive the requirement that a veteran make copayments for medications, hospital care, nursing home care, and medical services if:

 an error committed by the VA or a VA employee was the cause of delaying copayment notification to the veteran, and the veteran received such notification later than 120 days (18 months in the case of a non-VA facility) after the date on which the veteran received the care or services. In requiring a veteran to make a copayment for care or services provided at a VA or a non-VA medical facility the VA shall notify the veteran not later than 120 days (18 months in the case of a non-VA facility) after the date on which the veteran received the care or services. If the VA does not provide notification by such date it may not collect the payment, including through a third-party entity, unless the veteran is provided with:

 information about applying for a waiver and establishing a payment plan with the VA, and opportunity to make a waiver or establish a payment plan. The VA shall review and improve its copayment billing internal controls and notification procedures.</summary>
