  <summary date="2015-01-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cyber Defense National Guard Act

 Requires the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress regarding the feasibility of establishing a Cyber Defense National Guard.

Requires the report to address: (1) the number of persons who would be needed to defend the critical infrastructure of the United States from a cyber attack or man-made intentional or unintentional catastrophic incident; (2) elements of the federal government that would be best equipped to recruit, train, and manage such a National Guard; (3) resources that can be pre-positioned and training that can be instilled to assure responsiveness if an incident disrupts communications in a region or area; (4) logistics of allowing governors to use such a National Guard in states during times of cyber emergency; and (5) whether a force trained to defend U.S. networks in a major attack or natural or man-made disaster will benefit overall efforts to defend the interests of the United States.</summary>
