          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Highlights: </b></p> <p>This bill provides FY2017 appropriations for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; continuing appropriations through December 9, 2016, for other federal agencies; and FY2016 supplemental appropriations to respond to the Zika virus. </p> <p>The bill also includes several rescissions and provides additional funding for disaster relief. The bill includes four divisions: </p> <ul> <li>Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017; </li> <li> Zika Response and Preparedness; </li> <li> Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017; and</li> <li>Rescissions of Funds. </li> </ul> <p><i>Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 </i></p> <p>This division provides FY2017 appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military construction, military family housing, the U.S. share of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program, and base closures and realignments. </p> <p>The division also provides appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans benefit and health care programs, Departmental Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. </p> <p>Related agencies and programs funded in the division include the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims; the Armed Forces Retirement Home; and the Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery. </p> <p>The division includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. It increases FY2017 discretionary funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs above FY2016 levels, including an increase for the VA and a decrease for Military Construction. </p> <p>The division includes provisions that: </p> <ul> <li> permit the VA to pay for fertility treatments, counseling, and adoption expenses for veterans with certain service-connected disabilities; </li> <li> establish additional procedures and protections for VA whistle-blowers;</li> <li>and prohibit funds from being used for: (1) constructing, renovating, or expanding a facility for the purpose of housing individuals detained at U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and (2) closing or transferring the facility. </li> </ul> <p><i>Zika Response and Preparedness </i></p> This division provides FY2016 supplemental appropriations to the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and State to respond to the Zika virus. <p>The division permits the funds to be used for the duration of FY2017, designates the funds as emergency requirements, and sets forth congressional reporting and notification requirements. <p><i>Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 </i></p> <p>This division provides continuing appropriations to federal agencies through December 9, 2016, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation.</p> <p> It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because eleven of the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted (excluding the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 included in this bill). </p> <p>This division funds most projects and activities at the FY2016 levels, with the inclusion of an across-the-board reduction of less than 1% to most programs.
