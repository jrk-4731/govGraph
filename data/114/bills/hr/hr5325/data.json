    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on September 28, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nHighlights: \n\nThis bill provides FY2017 appropriations for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies; continuing appropriations through December 9, 2016, for other federal agencies; and FY2016 supplemental appropriations to respond to the Zika virus.\n\nThe bill also includes several rescissions and provides additional funding for disaster relief. The bill includes four divisions:\n\n Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017; Zika Response and Preparedness; Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017; and Rescissions of Funds. Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nThis division provides FY2017 appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military construction, military family housing, the U.S. share of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program, and base closures and realignments.\n\nThe division also provides appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans benefit and health care programs, Departmental Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration.\n\nRelated agencies and programs funded in the division include the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims; the Armed Forces Retirement Home; and the Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe division includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. It increases FY2017 discretionary funding for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs above FY2016 levels, including an increase for the VA and a decrease for Military Construction.\n\nThe division includes provisions that:\n\n permit the VA to pay for fertility treatments, counseling, and adoption expenses for veterans with certain service-connected disabilities; establish additional procedures and protections for VA whistle-blowers; and prohibit funds from being used for: (1) constructing, renovating, or expanding a facility for the purpose of housing individuals detained at U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and (2) closing or transferring the facility. Zika Response and Preparedness \n\nThis division provides FY2016 supplemental appropriations to the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and State to respond to the Zika virus. The division permits the funds to be used for the duration of FY2017, designates the funds as emergency requirements, and sets forth congressional reporting and notification requirements. Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nThis division provides continuing appropriations to federal agencies through December 9, 2016, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation.\n\n It is known as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when FY2017 begins on October 1, 2016, because eleven of the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted (excluding the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 included in this bill).\n\nThis division funds most projects and activities at the FY2016 levels, with the inclusion of an across-the-board reduction of less than 1% to most programs. The division also includes a number of exceptions which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations to various programs, including additional funding for disaster recovery efforts.\n\nThe division also extends several programs that are scheduled to expire at the end of FY2016.\n\nRescissions Of Funds \n\nThis division rescinds unobligated balances of funds from several agencies and programs throughout the federal government.\n\nFull Summary: \n\nContinuing Appropriations and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, and Zika Response and Preparedness Act \n\n(Sec. 3) Specifies that references to \"this Act\" included in any division refer only to the provisions of the division unless the bill expressly provides otherwise.\n\n(Sec. 4) Specifies that the sums in this bill are appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated for FY2017.\n\n(Sec. 5) Specifies that each amount in this bill designated by Congress as an emergency requirement is contingent on the President also designating all of the emergency amounts and transmitting the designations to Congress.\n\n(Sec. 6) Specifies that the explanatory statement regarding this bill that was printed in the Congressional Record has the same effect as a joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference.\n\nDIVISION A--MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017\n\nTITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n\nProvides appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for Military Construction for:\n\n the Army; the Navy and Marine Corps; the Air Force; Defense-Wide agencies and activities (other than military departments); the Army and Air National Guard; and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Reserves.
