  <summary date="2015-03-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medical Freedom Act of 2015

This bill repeals provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 relating to health insurance, health savings accounts, and health flexible spending accounts, including provisions prohibiting annual or lifetime limits on benefits, requiring preventive care without cost sharing, requiring dependent coverage until age 26, prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions, guaranteeing availability and renewability of coverage, and prohibiting payments for over-the-counter medications from health savings accounts and health flexible spending arrangements. Provisions of law amended by those provisions are restored as if PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 had not been enacted.

&#8220;Qualified health plan&#8221; is expanded to include any health plan. Currently, a health plan must provide essential health benefits and meet other requirements to be a qualified health plan. (Under PPACA, qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are eligible for premium subsidies, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.)

A qualified health plan is allowed to provide coverage through any qualified direct primary care medical home plan. Currently, in such an arrangement, the qualified direct primary care medical home plan must coordinate its services with the qualified health plan and meet other requirements.

Dental plans no longer need to provide pediatric dental benefits to be offered on a health insurance exchange.</summary>
