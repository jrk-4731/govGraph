The CFTC may exempt contracts, agreements, or transactions from the fee if the exemption is consistent with: (1) the public interest; (2) the equal treatment of contract markets, derivatives clearing organizations, and market participants; and (3) the operation of a nationwide market system.\n\nThe bill also establishes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Reserve Fund in the Treasury and requires the CFTC to impose and collect an additional fee to be deposited into the Fund. The CFTC may obligate amounts in the Fund for long-term investments in information technology and unexpected expenses. The balance in the fund is limited to $50 million."
