 This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should actively encourage prosecution of war crimes suspects and Nazi war criminals.

 The President shall submit a report for each of FY2017-FY2021 that identifies each country that is failing to: (1) cooperate with relevant jurisdictions in extraditing or deporting war crimes suspects or Nazi war criminals to the appropriate jurisdiction; (2) enforce arrest warrants issued by an international tribunal against war crimes suspects; (3) accept Nazi war criminals deported from the United States; or (4) effectively prosecute war crimes suspects or Nazi war criminals within such country's jurisdiction, including Nazi war criminals who resided in the United States and were deported from or extradited by the United States or left the United States voluntarily.

 The President may not issue a letter of offer to sell defense articles under the Arms Export Control Act for $7 million or more to an identified country.

 The President may waive such prohibition in the U.S. national security interest.</summary>
