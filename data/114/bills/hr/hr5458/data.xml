Veterans TRICARE Choice Act of 2016

 (Sec. 2) This bill allows, as of January 1, 2017, an individual who is eligible to be a covered beneficiary entitled to health care benefits under the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense [DOD] managed health care program) and who is not serving on active duty in the uniformed services to: (1) elect to be ineligible to enroll in TRICARE, (2) make tax deductible contributions to a health savings account during the period such individual elects to be ineligible for TRICARE coverage, and (3) enroll in the TRICARE program at a later date during a special enrollment period.

 DOD shall submit to the Internal Revenue Service information on each TRICARE-eligible individual who makes such election for purposes of determining such individual's eligibility for a health savings account.

 DOD shall provide to each TRICARE-eligible individual who seeks to make such election information regarding: (1) health savings accounts, and (2) changing an election.</summary>
