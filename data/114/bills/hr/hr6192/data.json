    "text": "Responsible Law Enforcement Acquisition Act of 2016\n\nThis bill changes the program (known as the 1033 program) under which the Department of Defense (DOD) may transfer surplus military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies at no cost to a program under which such property is transferred by auction and the proceeds are deposited in the Treasury.\n\nThe bill requires that the recipient be a state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency that is the high bidder at an auction that is open only to such agencies and is conducted by DOD or a DOD-contracted entity.\n\nThe program preference for property transfers for use in counter drug, counterterrorism, or border security activities is eliminated.\n\nDOD is prohibited from transferring personal property to a recipient agency without charge.\n\nThe bill prohibits an executive agency from using available funds or fees to carry out or enforce any executive order, rule, regulation, or any other executive branch policy issued on or after January 16, 2015, that has the effect of establishing an interagency working group regarding: (1) the DOD transfer of personal property to state, local, or tribal law enforcement agencies; or (2) the use of such property."
