  <summary date="2015-06-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Broadband Adoption Act of 2015

Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adopt a final rule establishing support under the Universal Service Fund Lifeline Assistance Program for qualifying low-income consumers in urban and rural areas to purchase broadband Internet access service at reduced charges by reimbursing participating providers for each such consumer served.

Requires the program to allow qualifying consumers to elect to apply support from the Lifeline program to basic telephone service, voice telephony service, or broadband Internet access service, regardless of whether the service is purchased as a stand-alone service or in a bundle.

Directs the FCC to consult with the federal-state joint board on universal service regarding ways to encourage states to develop programs in conjunction with the Lifeline program.

Requires the program to be technology neutral to promote competition from service providers.

Requires participating broadband Internet access service providers to obtain FCC authorization to participate in the Lifeline program, but a provider is not required to be an eligible telecommunications carrier to receive support under the program.

Directs the FCC to: (1) adopt regulations to prevent receipt of duplicative support under the Lifeline program, and (2) establish a national database to determine consumer eligibility.</summary>
