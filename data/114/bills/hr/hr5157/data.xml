  <summary date="2016-04-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">School Modernization and Revitalization Through Jobs Act, the SMART Jobs Act, or the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act

This bill requires the Department&#160;of Education (ED) to make grants to states for the modernization, renovation, or repair of public schools, including early learning facilities and charter schools. The bill allocates grant funds among states on the basis of the relative portion of school improvement funds provided to local educational agencies (LEAs) in each state under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. States shall reallocate the grant funds to LEAs on the basis of each LEA's share of school improvement funds received by LEAs in the state for the previous fiscal year.

In addition, ED shall&#160;make grants to LEAs that serve specified disaster areas for the construction, modernization, renovation, or repair of public schools, including early learning facilities and charter schools. The bill allocates grant funds among LEAs on the basis of each LEA's share of infrastructure damage inflicted on public school facilities in such areas.

With specified exceptions, only U.S.-produced iron, steel, and manufactured goods shall be used in projects funded under the bill.</summary>
