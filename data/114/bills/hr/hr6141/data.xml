This bill amends the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 to require the President to publish on a publicly available website the U.S. negotiating position and each new U.S. proposal for a proposed trade agreement at the conclusion of each negotiating round.

Trade authorities procedures (fast track) shall not apply to any implementing bill with respect to a trade agreement if during the 60-day period that one House of Congress passes a resolution of disapproval for the President's failure to publish U.S. positions with respect to each trade negotiation round, the other House separately agrees to a resolution of disapproval.

The bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to direct the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to ensure that the Chief Transparency Officer of the Office of the USTR does not have, or appear to have, any conflict of interest in ensuring the transparency of the activities of the Office, including trade negotiations.</summary>
