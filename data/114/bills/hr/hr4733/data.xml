  <summary date="2016-07-05T14:37:48Z" status="Reported to House without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2003 to authorize the U.S. Capitol Police, by interagency transfer, donation, sale, trade-in, or other appropriate method, to dispose of any property in their possession because it has been disposed of, forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed. (Currently the U.S. Capitol Police are authorized to use these methods to dispose of only their own surplus or obsolete property.)

Upon notifying specified congressional committees, the U.S. Capitol Police may accept surplus or obsolete property offered by another federal department, agency, or office.</summary>
