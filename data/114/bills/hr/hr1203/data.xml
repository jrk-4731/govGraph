  <summary date="2015-03-02T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to remove the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prohibit the specification, or restrict the use, of an area as a disposal site for discharges of dredged or fill materials into waters of the United States once the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has issued a permit for the discharge.

The bill applies to discharge permits issued: (1) after this bill's enactment, and (2) on or before enactment if the EPA failed to submit to the Army Corps a written objection to the permit prior to the Army Corps' issuance of the permit.</summary>
