This bill declares that, if the indebtedness of a member of the uniformed services to the United States occurs, through no fault of the member, as a result of the overpayment of pay or allowances or upon the settlement of the member's accounts, the department or agency concerned may not recover the indebtedness from the member, including a retired or former member, using deductions from pay, deductions from retired or separation pay, or any other collection method unless recovery of the indebtedness begins before the end of the 10-year period beginning on the date on which the indebtedness was incurred.</summary>
