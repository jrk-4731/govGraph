  <summary date="2015-02-25T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Realign and Eliminate Duplicative Unnecessary Costly Excess in Government Act of 2015 or the REDUCE Government Act

Establishes the Federal&#160;Realignment and Closure Commission, which shall: (1) establish a systematic method for assessing the effectiveness and accountability of agency programs, excluding Department of Defense programs; (2) divide the programs into three approximately equal budgetary groupings; (3) assess the effectiveness and accountability of all programs within a grouping in each of 2017, 2019, and 2021; and (4) by June 30 of each such year, submit a plan with recommendations of the agencies and programs that should be realigned or eliminated within the grouping assessed.

Requires the Commission to recommend: (1) the realignment of agencies or programs that are performing the same essential function that can be consolidated or streamlined into a single agency or program; and (2) the elimination of&#160;agencies or programs that have completed their intended purpose, have become irrelevant, or have failed to meet their objectives. Authorizes the Commission to recommend the realignment or elimination of any agency or program that has wasted federal funds by: (1) spending funds on items outside its authorized mission, (2) mismanaging resources and personnel, or (3) using such funds for personal benefit or the benefit of a special interest group.

Requires the President: (1) by August 15 of each such year, to transmit a report containing the President's approval or disapproval of the Commission's plan and recommendations; (2) to transmit a copy of an approved plan and recommendations to Congress; and (3) to eliminate or realign&#160; agencies and programs pursuant to such recommendations unless Congress enacts a resolution disapproving them.

Requires funds saved by implementation of such plan to be used for deficit reduction.</summary>
