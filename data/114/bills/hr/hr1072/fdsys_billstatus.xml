Authorizes the Commission to recommend the realignment or elimination of any agency or program that has wasted federal funds by: (1) spending funds on items outside its authorized mission, (2) mismanaging resources and personnel, or (3) using such funds for personal benefit or the benefit of a special interest group. </p> <p>Requires the President: (1) by August 15 of each such year, to transmit a report containing the President's approval or disapproval of the Commission's plan and recommendations; (2) to transmit a copy of an approved plan and recommendations to Congress; and (3) to eliminate or realign&nbsp; agencies and programs pursuant to such recommendations unless Congress enacts a resolution disapproving them. </p> <p>Requires funds saved by implementation of such plan to be used for deficit reduction.</p>]]></text>
