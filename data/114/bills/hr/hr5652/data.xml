This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to permit a health plan with no deductible for medical management of a chronic disease to be treated as a high deductible health plan for purposes of health savings account eligibility requirements.

A chronic condition or disease must be expected to last for more than one year, limit what a person can do, and require ongoing medical monitoring. Medical management of a chronic disease is medical care which has the primary purpose of managing the condition or disease by preventing the onset, further deterioration, or complications associated with it.</summary>
