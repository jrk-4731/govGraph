This prohibition applies until a specified period has passed following a determination by the Department of Health and Human Services that certified EHR technology is applicable to that setting.\n\nCurrent law limits state reimbursement\u00a0for DME under Medicaid to Medicare payment rates beginning\u00a0January 1, 2019. The bill accelerates this limitation such that it begins October 1, 2018.\u00a0"
