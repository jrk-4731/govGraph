  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Storage Technology for Operational Readiness and Generating Energy Act or the S.T.O.R.A.G.E. Act

This bill amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to add energy storage systems to the list of strategies states should consider when developing energy plans and using its utility ratemaking authority.

States are encouraged to analyze whether energy storage systems benefit their efforts to promote energy conservation and the greater use of domestic energy.

To further encourage the development of programs relating to energy storage, the Department of Energy (DOE) must streamline and coordinate efforts among various existing programs conducting energy storage research at DOE to maximize efficiency of its funds and expand vital research.</summary>
