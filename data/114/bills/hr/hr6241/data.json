During that period, the FDA and product sponsor must negotiate and finalize product labeling and, for a medical device, classify the device.\n\nCongress may pass a joint resolution to grant reciprocal marketing approval to a product that the FDA declines to approve through this process.\n\nUser fees apply to requests for reciprocal marketing approval.\n\nThe FDA must encourage the sponsors of potentially eligible products to request reciprocal marketing approval."
