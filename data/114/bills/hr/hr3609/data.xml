  <summary date="2015-09-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to modify requirements for payment under the Medicare program for ambulance services furnished by critical access hospitals (CAHs), which are rural community hospitals that meet specified criteria and receive special payment.

Under current law, ambulance services furnished either by a CAH or by an entity owned or operated by a CAH are paid at a rate of 101% of reasonable costs incurred in furnishing those services, as long as the CAH or entity is the only provider of ambulance services that is located within a 35-mile drive of the CAH. The bill maintains this requirement but further requires that the CAH or entity furnishing the ambulance services be licensed or otherwise authorized to furnish services in the state in which the CAH is located.</summary>
