Priority for these grants is given to programs that are administered cooperatively by law enforcement personnel and mental health and substance abuse professionals.\n\n(Sec. 14025) Regarding response to individuals with mental illness, DOJ must provide direction and guidance on: (1) training programs for federal first responders and tactical units, and (2) systems to provide timely information to federal law enforcement agencies and criminal justice agencies.\n\n(Sec. 14026) The GAO must report on: (1) the practices used by federal first responders, tactical units, and corrections officers in responding to individuals with mental illness, (2) the application of evidence-based practices in criminal justice settings to better address individuals with mental illnesses, and (3) how DOJ can expand and improve information sharing and dissemination of best practices.\n\n(Sec. 14027) The bill revises priority considerations for Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program grants to prioritize applications that: (1) propose interventions that reduce recidivism, and (2) target certain offenders with a moderate or high risk of recidivism and a need for treatment and services.\n\n(Sec. 14028) The bill revises the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program to include certain veterans and violent offenders as preliminarily qualified offenders.\n\n(Sec. 14029) The bill revises the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program to make grants subject to audits, prohibit certain nonprofits with offshore accounts from receiving grants, limit spending on conferences, and prevent duplicative grants.\n\nDIVISION C--INCREASING CHOICE, ACCESS, AND QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICANS\n\nIncreasing Choice, Access, and Quality in Health Care for Americans Act\n\nTITLE XV--PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDICARE PART A\n\n (Sec. 15001) The bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0to develop, with respect to claims for hospital services,\u00a0codes under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) for similar inpatient and outpatient hospital services.\n\n(Sec. 15002) The bill establishes processes for adjusting a hospital's Medicare payments based on the hospital's overall proportion of inpatients who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n(Sec. 15003) The bill extends for five years the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program, through which Medicare pays certain rural hospitals on the basis of reasonable incurred costs rather than under the standard prospective payment system.\n\n(Sec. 15004) With respect to\u00a0long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), the bill lifts\u00a0a moratorium on bed increases. The bill reduces rates for high-cost outlier payments, which are additional Medicare payments made in extraordinarily high-cost cases.\n\n(Sec. 15005) The bill reduces the amount by which hospital payment rates for inpatient services increase in FY2018.\n\n (Sec. 15006) The bill amends the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 to revise the applicability of\u00a0certain Medicare payment rules exempting LTCHs from negative payment adjustments for admissions from certain co-located hospitals beyond specified thresholds. These rules shall apply for an additional period beginning on October 1, 2016.\n\n(Sec. 15007) In addition, the bill amends the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 to expand to all LTCHs the application of a payment rule that requires the exclusion of certain patients for purposes of calculating length of stay. Under current law, the payment rule\u00a0applies\u00a0only to a hospital that was classified as an LTCH as of a specified date.\n\n(Sec. 15008) The bill removes certain hospitals specializing in neoplastic disease from their classification as LTCHs for purposes of Medicare payment.\n\n (Sec. 15009) With specified exceptions, current law applies certain payment limits\u00a0to inpatient services for LTCHs that do not meet\u00a0specified discharge requirements. The bill: (1)\u00a0establishes a new temporary exception to these limits for certain spinal cord specialty hospitals, and (2) expands an existing temporary exception with respect to certain discharges involving severe wounds.\n\nTITLE XVI--PROVISIONS RELATING TO MEDICARE PART B\n\n (Sec. 16001) The bill excludes certain off-campus outpatient departments\u00a0(OPDs) from\u00a0specified rules\u00a0that mandate\u00a0lower Medicare payments. Specifically, the exclusion applies to: (1)\u00a0cancer hospitals in off-campus OPDs, and (2) mid-build OPDs.\u00a0A \"mid-build\" OPD is one for which the provider had, before a certain date, a binding written agreement with an outside party for construction.\n\n(Sec. 16003) With respect to payment reductions for failing to meet requirements for the meaningful use of electronic health records, the bill exempts eligible professionals who are based in ambulatory surgical centers.\n\n (Sec. 16004) The bill requires the\u00a0CMS\u00a0to continue to instruct Medicare contractors not to enforce requirements for direct physician supervision of outpatient therapeutic services in critical access and small rural hospitals through 2016. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must report on the effect of extending this instruction on: (1)\u00a0Medicare beneficiaries, and (2) hospital staffing needs.\n\n(Sec. 16005) The bill amends the Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act to delay by six months the implementation of\u00a0specified Medicare fee schedule adjustments\u00a0with respect to\u00a0certain accessories and seating systems used with complex rehabilitation technology wheelchairs.\n\n (Sec. 16006) The bill allows physical therapists to utilize \"locum tenens\" arrangements (through which a substitute practitioner is retained when the regular practitioner is absent\u00a0for a reason such as illness or pregnancy)\u00a0under Medicare in the same manner as physicians are allowed to use utilize such arrangements under current law.\n\n (Sec. 16007)\u00a0The CMS shall: (1)\u00a0delay by\u00a0six months the full implementation of new Medicare payment rates for durable medical equipment (DME), and (2) study and report on the impact of applicable payment adjustments on the availability of DME to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n (Sec. 16008) Under current law, the CMS must use payment information from competitive acquisition programs to make payment adjustments for DME items furnished in areas outside of such programs. Current law also allows, but does not require,\u00a0the CMS to make such adjustments with respect to certain orthotics (such as splints and braces) and parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies (such as feeding tubes).\u00a0The bill requires the CMS, in making\u00a0these adjustments, to account for\u00a0stakeholder input. In addition, the CMS must account for a comparison of competitive acquisition areas and other areas with respect to the following factors:\n\n average travel distance and cost associated with furnishing items and services, average volume of items and services furnished by suppliers, and number of suppliers. TITLE XVII--OTHER MEDICARE PROVISIONS\n\n (Sec. 17001) Until plan year 2019, the CMS may not terminate a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan solely because the plan failed to achieve a specified minimum quality rating.\n\n(Sec. 17002) The CMS\u00a0must annually report on specified Medicare enrollment data.\n\n(Sec. 17003) The CMS\u00a0shall: (1) request information and recommendations from stakeholders on information included in the\u00a0Welcome to Medicare package, and (2)\u00a0update the information included in the\u00a0package accordingly.\n\n (Sec. 17004) Current law allows\u00a0the CMS to impose a temporary moratorium on the enrollment of new providers under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) if necessary to combat fraud, waste, or abuse. With specified exceptions, the bill prohibits payment under these programs to new providers in areas subject to such temporary moratorium.\n\n (Sec. 17005) The bill expands and modifies enrollment and disenrollment options for MA-eligible individuals. Specifically, the bill extends the annual period in which an individual enrolled in MA may elect to instead receive benefits under the original Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program as well as elect to change qualified prescription drug coverage. Furthermore, any MA-eligible individual (whether or not enrolled in MA) may once per period change a previous election with respect to receiving benefits through MA or Medicare FFS, including changing from one MA plan to another. Unsolicited marketing during this period is prohibited.\n\n (Sec. 17006) The bill allows individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to be eligible for MA. Under current law, only individuals who develop ESRD while already enrolled in an MA plan may be considered eligible.\n\nWith respect to payment, the bill: (1) shifts responsibility for the cost of kidney acquisitions from MA plans to Medicare's\u00a0FFS program, and (2)\u00a0excludes\u00a0such costs\u00a0from the calculation of certain benchmarks that\u00a0form the basis for payment under MA plans.\n\nThe CMS must conduct, and post online the results of, an evaluation of whether to include in a plan's quality rating a measure specifically related to care for MA enrollees with ESRD.\n\nThe bill also modifies risk adjustment with respect to MA plans. Specifically, in making such adjustments, the CMS must:\n\n take into account\u00a0an MA enrollee's total number of diseases or conditions, use at least two years of diagnostic data, provide separate adjustments for\u00a0individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and evaluate whether other specified factors should be included in the risk adjustment model. (Sec. 17007) The bill establishes additional requirements for assigning Medicare\u00a0FFS beneficiaries to accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Medicare shared savings program. (The program enables ACOs to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the basis for assignment to reflect beneficiaries' utilization of not only primary care services provided by ACO physicians, but also those furnished in federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics.\n\nTITLE XVIII--OTHER PROVISIONS\n\n (Sec. 18001) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and other laws to exempt qualified small employer health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) from certain requirements that apply to group health plans.\n\nA qualified small employer HRA is offered by employers that have fewer than 50 full-time employees and do not offer group health plans to any of their employees. A qualified small employer HRA must:\n\n be provided on the same terms to all eligible employees of the employer; be funded solely by the employer without salary reduction contributions; provide, after an employee provides proof of coverage, for the payment or reimbursement of medical expenses of the employee and family members; and limit annual payments and reimbursements to specified dollar amounts. HRAs that meet these requirements are not considered group health plans and are exempt from various requirements that apply to group health plans, including coverage and cost-sharing requirements. (Under current law, employers that sponsor group health plans that do not meet specified requirements are subject to an excise tax.)\n\nCoverage and payments under a qualified HRA are excluded from gross income, unless the employee does not have minimum essential coverage for the month in which the medical care was provided.\n\nEmployers offering a qualified HRA must notify employees in advance regarding permitted benefits and report benefit information on W-2 forms and to health exchanges.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements for determining whether an employee covered under an HRA is also eligible for premium subsidies under PPACA."
