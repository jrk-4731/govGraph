This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to&#160;limit the use of ESEA funds for contributions to teacher retirement or pension systems in excess of the normal cost of benefits for&#160;an applicable&#160;plan year.

Specifically, the bill prohibits a state from requiring a local educational agency to use ESEA funds to make such excess payments to a teacher retirement or pension system. However, this limitation shall not apply to a system for a given plan year if the system certifies that, with respect to the plan year, the ratio of the value of the system's assets to its accrued liability exceeds 50%.</summary>
