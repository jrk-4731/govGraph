This bill amends the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 to extend and expand the Medicaid community mental health services demonstration program. Under current law, the program is limited to no more than eight states.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)&#160;shall extend an existing program and may expand the number of programs if, with respect to the requesting state,&#160;CMS determines that: (1) the state's participation in the program will measurably improve access to, and participation in, specified behavioral health services; and (2) the state is in full compliance with specified reporting requirements.

The bill also specifies that, for purposes of implementing specified CMS guidance on demonstration program testing, a "clinical visit" includes on-site behavioral health services, certain community services, and telehealth services.</summary>
