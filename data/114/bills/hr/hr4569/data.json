Under current law, the program is limited to no more than eight states.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u00a0shall extend an existing program and may expand the number of programs if, with respect to the requesting state,\u00a0CMS determines that: (1) the state's participation in the program will measurably improve access to, and participation in, specified behavioral health services; and (2) the state is in full compliance with specified reporting requirements.\n\nThe bill also specifies that, for purposes of implementing specified CMS guidance on demonstration program testing, a \"clinical visit\" includes on-site behavioral health services, certain community services, and telehealth services."
