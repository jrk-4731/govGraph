  <summary date="2015-01-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Freedom of Travel Act of 2015

 This bill prohibits the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from performing any security screening operations except: (1) screening passengers and property; and (2) prescribing standards for the employment of air carrier personnel and, as appropriate, airport security personnel. It nullifies any Act authorizing the TSA to perform any other security screening operations.

The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 is amended to repeal the authority of the DHS Secretary, acting through the TSA Administrator, to develop Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams to augment security of public transportation.</summary>
