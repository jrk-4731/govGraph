  <summary date="2015-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Prohibiting Assistance to Nuclear Iran Act

This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to provide Iran with assistance (including the use of the U.S. Armed Forces) to develop, use, or protect any technology or other assets of its nuclear program.

The President may waive such prohibition on a case-by-case basis if: (1) the President submits to Congress a certification that it is necessary to U.S. national interests to do so, and (2) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving such certification within five days of its submission.</summary>
