This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to issue a benefit guarantee certificate to each individual entitled to benefits under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act.

Any such certificate constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts, and represents the obligation of the federal government to provide for payment of OASDI benefits named on the certificate, as adjusted (for inflation or otherwise), to the individual to whom it is issued.</summary>
