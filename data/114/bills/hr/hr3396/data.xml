The Office of Minority Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may make grants to health entities, including public health agencies, health centers, community-based organizations, or faith-based organizations for HIV/AIDS: (1) education and outreach activities, (2) prevention and access to treatment, and (3) testing. Priority must be given to applications that propose to serve minority groups with an HIV occurrence rate that exceeds a minimum determined by HHS.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration may make grants to provide HIV testing, counseling, and referral for medical treatment to youth who are members of minority groups, are HIV positive or at risk for HIV/AIDS, and are engaged in substance abuse.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may make grants for public health intervention and prevention activities with respect to minority groups, including: (1) rapid HIV testing, (2) measures to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and minimize its symptoms, (3) outreach activities, and (4) referrals to health and mental health resources and health organizations.

The CDC must: (1) expand and intensify HIV/AIDS prevention and education activities for minority groups, and (2) implement a national media outreach campaign that urges sexually active members of minority groups to be tested for and know their HIV/AIDS status.

The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities may make grants to study behavioral factors that lead to increased HIV/AIDS prevalence in minority groups.</summary>
