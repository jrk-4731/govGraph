(Sec. 8) The bill revises the process for: (1) federal agencies to grant or deny a tribe's request to waive statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirements to efficiently implement an integration plan; and (2) the Department of the Interior to approve or disapprove an integration plan. A tribe is granted certain hearing and appeal rights if Interior disapproves its plan.\n\n (Sec. 10) Tribal authority to use funds to place participants in training positions with employers is revised.\n\n (Sec. 13) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must receive and distribute funds for use in accordance with an approved integration plan.\n\n(Sec. 14) Funds transferred to a tribe must be treated as non-federal funds for purposes of meeting matching requirements, except funds administered by the Department of Labor or the Department of Health and Human Services. Civil liability limitations apply to approved integration plans."
