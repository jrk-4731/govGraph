  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits any alien from being naturalized until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement completes the digitization of all remaining paper-based fingerprint records for inclusion in the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS shall, upon completion of such digitization and prior to naturalizing an alien who has a application pending on the date of enactment of this bill, review the alien's eligibility for naturalization using the updated IDENT.

The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to require a DHS officer or employee who has good cause to believe that a naturalized citizen has illegally or by misrepresentation procured such status to refer such case to the Department of Justice for denaturalization proceedings.</summary>
