This bill prohibits any person from making any statement or engaging in any act that misrepresents: (1) whether the person holds a state health care license; or (2) the person's education, training, degree, license, or clinical expertise.

A person's advertisement for the person's health care services must disclose the license under which the person is authorized to provide those services.

A violation of this Act is an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

 The Federal Trade Commission must study and report to Congress on health care professionals' misrepresentations under this Act.</summary>
