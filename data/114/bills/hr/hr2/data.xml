Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to report to Congress on the relationship between: (1) physician and other health professional utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) of items and services for which Medicare payment is made; and (2) total utilization and expenditures (and their rate of increase) under Medicare parts A (Hospital Insurance), B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), and D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program). Requires a separate report on the 2015-2019 update to physicians' services under Medicare.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to consolidate components of the three specified existing performance incentive programs into a new Merit-based Incentive Payment (MIP) system under which eligible professionals (including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified registered nurse anesthetists, but excluding most APM participants) shall receive annual payment increases or decreases based on their performance as measured by standards the Secretary shall establish according to specified criteria.

Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to: (1) evaluate the MIP System; (2) examine the similarities and differences in the use of quality measures under the original Medicare fee-for-service program under SSAct title XVIII parts A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), the Medicare Advantage program under SSAct title XVIII part C (Medicare+Choice), selected state medical assistance programs under SSA title XIX (Medicaid), and private payer arrangements; and (3) make recommendations on how to reduce the administrative burden in applying such measures.

Directs GAO also to: (1) examine whether entities that pool financial risk for physician practices, such as independent risk managers, can play a role in supporting such practices, particularly small physician practices, in assuming financial risk for the treatment of patients; (2) report on the transition of professionals in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas to an APM; and (3) make recommendations for removing administrative barriers to such arrangements, on the one hand, and practices, including small practices, in such areas to participate in APM models.

Establishes an ad hoc Physician-Focused Payment Technical Advisory Committee to make comments and recommendations to the Secretary on physician-focused payment models..

Prescribes requirements for incentive payments to eligible APM participants.

Directs the Secretary to study: (1) the feasibility of integrating APMs into the Medicare Advantage payment system; and (2) the applicability of federal fraud prevention laws to items and services paid for under an APM.

(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to make payments for chronic care management services furnished by a physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife.

Directs the Secretary to conduct an education and outreach campaign to inform relevant professionals and Medicare part B enrollees of the benefits of chronic care management services.

(Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to make publicly available, on an annual basis, information with respect to physicians and other eligible professionals on items and services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.

(Sec. 105) Expands the kinds of uses of Medicare data available to qualified entities for quality improvement activities.

Directs the Secretary to provide Medicare data to qualified clinical data registries to facilitate quality improvement or patient safety.

(Sec. 106) Allows continuing renewals of any two-year period for which a physician or practitioner opts out of the Medicare claims process under a private contract.

Directs the Secretary to make publicly available through an appropriate HHS website information on the number and characteristics of opt-out physicians and practitioners.

Declares it a national objective to achieve widespread exchange of health information through interoperable certified electronic health records (EHR) technology nationwide by December 31, 2018. Directs the Secretary to establish related metrics.
