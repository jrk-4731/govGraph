This bill expresses the sense of Congress that it is in the best interests of the United States to consistently promote and assist Native Hawaiian Organizations, which are deemed to be economically disadvantaged for purposes of Small Business Administration (SBA) procurement contract requirements.

 The Small Business Act is amended to designate these Organizations as HUBZone (historically underutilized business zone) small businesses for purposes of SBA assistance.</summary>
