  <summary date="2015-07-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">America's Energy Security Trust Fund Act of 2015

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax, beginning in calendar year 2016, on any taxable carbon substance sold by its manufacturer, producer, or importer. Defines "taxable carbon substance" as: (1) coal (including lignite and peat); (2) petroleum and any petroleum products; and (3) natural gas that is extracted, manufactured, or produced in the United States, or entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing.

Establishes in the Treasury the America's Energy Security Trust Fund to assist industries negatively affected by this Act, make transfers to the Highway Trust Fund to cover shortfalls, and provide payroll tax relief.

Allows individual taxpayers a tax credit equal to carbon tax rebate amounts calculated by the Department of the Treasury.

Directs Treasury to study and report to Congress on the best methods to assess and collect taxes on non-carbon greenhouse gases.

Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should establish binding agreements with major greenhouse gas emitting nations to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</summary>
