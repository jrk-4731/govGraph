  <summary date="2015-04-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Secure Delivery for America Act of 2015

Declares that it is the policy of the United States Postal Service (USPS) to: (1) provide access to secure, convenient package delivery receptacles to the greatest number of postal patrons feasible; and (2) use the most cost-effective primary mode of mail delivery feasible.

Directs USPS to: (1) provide a primary mode of mail delivery other than door delivery, with a preference for secure, centralized delivery, for new addresses established after September 30, 2016; and (2) implement a program to convert existing business addresses with door delivery to centralized delivery.

Requires: (1) each USPS district office to identify residential addresses within its service area that are appropriate candidates for conversion to centralized, curbside, or sidewalk delivery; and (2) USPS to seek to voluntarily make such conversion.

Requires the USPS, in making conversion determinations, to consider: (1) the impact of weather conditions, physical barriers, or any other factor on the feasibility of providing a primary mode of mail delivery other than door delivery; (2) whether the address is of historic value; and (3) population density and the concentration of poverty.

Directs USPS to establish and maintain a waiver program for cases in which door delivery is necessary to avoid causing significant physical hardship or physical safety risks to a postal patron.

Requires USPS to: (1) convert at least 1.5 million of the door delivery points extant on December 31, 2015, to centralized, curbside, or sidewalk delivery during each of FY2017-FY2026, with priority to voluntary conversions; (2) convert delivery points to centralized delivery to the greatest extent feasible and include secure package lockers co-located with mail receptacles at the centralized delivery point; (3) establish procedures to place centralized delivery points in locations that maximize delivery efficiency, ease of use for postal patrons, and respect for private property rights; and (4) provide for a voucher program under which USPS may defray costs associated with conversion that would otherwise be borne by postal patrons.

Authorizes USPS to continue to provide door delivery for a fee to an address that received such delivery as of January 1, 2016, but was converted or scheduled to be converted to a different primary mode of mail delivery as a result of this Act's requirements.</summary>
