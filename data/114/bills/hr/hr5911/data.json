Each such report also shall examine:\n\n the levels of funding, personnel, and agency resources that are devoted to the task force; problems and difficulties associated with the development, implementation, and coordination of such programs; a comparison of the task force with similar organizations and programs employed by U.S. allies and partners; and proposed policy recommendations for developing coordinated, coherent, cohesive whole-government countering violent extremism programs."
