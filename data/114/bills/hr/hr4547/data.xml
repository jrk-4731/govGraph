  <summary date="2016-02-11T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Build the Fence Act of 2016

This bill amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to complete the required southwest border fencing by December 31, 2017.

The Secure Fence Act of 2006 is amended to direct DHS to achieve operational control over U.S. international land and maritime borders by the same date.

Until such fencing is completed:

 DHS may not obligate or expend any amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to it for facilities construction or maintenance, vehicle purchases, or other non-essential purchases or acquisitions; and no politically appointed DHS official or senior executive service employee may travel using government aircraft, receive any non-essential training, or receive any bonus pay salary increase.</summary>
