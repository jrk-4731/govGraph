This bill amends the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to bar states from prohibiting their state government, a political subdivision, or an Indian tribe from providing (i.e., serving as a "public provider" of) high-speed broadband telecommunications capabilities or services to persons or public or private entities.

A public provider that regulates competing private providers of such telecommunications services may not discriminate in favor of itself or a provider that it owns.</summary>
