(Sec. 1) This bill permits the Department of Transportation to authorize the use of a passenger facility charge to finance an eligible airport-related project if: (1) the eligible agency seeking to impose the new charge controls an airport where a $2 passenger facility charge became effective on January 1, 2013; and (2) such airport and the airport at which the project will be carried out were under the control of the same eligible agency on October 1, 2015. Not more than $120 million in passenger facility charges so collected may be used to carry out such a project.</summary>
