    "text": "This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to require all railroad carriers to establish and implement a fatigue management plan that identifies and evaluates any fatigue-related railroad safety hazards on its system and determine the degree of risk associated with each hazard.\n\nDOT shall ensure that railroad carriers provide their employees with predictable work and rest schedules that have either a defined start time or a minimum of 10 hours prior notification before being required to report to duty.\n\nA compromise of a civil penalty for violations of railroad safety regulations or orders may not reduce the minimum federal penalties set for such violations.\n\nDOT shall impose a penalty for a violation at least 30 days after its occurrence without regard to any correction of the violation by the liable party.\n\nThe bill revises standards for the installation of inward- and outward-facing imaging recording devices in all controlling locomotive cabs and cab car operating compartments of intercity rail passenger and commuter rail passenger trains.\n\nAn in-cab audio or image recording obtained by a railroad carrier may not be used to discipline or be used in an Federal Railroad Administration enforcement proceeding against a railroad employee.\n\nEach freight rail service carrier may voluntarily install DOT-approved inward- or outward-facing image recording devices in their trains."
