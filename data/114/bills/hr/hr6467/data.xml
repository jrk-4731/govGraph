  <summary date="2016-12-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Use It or Choose It Act of 2016

This bill allows an individual, when moving from one position (i.e., any form of compensated employment, including part-time employment and independent contracting) within the workforce to another, to elect to retain any benefits (i.e., health care-related benefits, workers compensation, life insurance, family and medical leave, and annual, sick, paternity, or maternity leave) earned when occupying such position.

The bill requires contractual providers of such benefits to extend them on the same terms and conditions as those provided to employees in the former position, or those similarly situated. Employers accruing funds or reserves corresponding to leave or other benefits shall transfer such funds or reserves to new employers upon request.</summary>
