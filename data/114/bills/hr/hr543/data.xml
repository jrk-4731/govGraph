  <summary date="2015-01-27T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Care Choice Act of 2015

Repeals the health insurance and health coverage expansion requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related requirements of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Restores provisions of law amended or repealed by those provisions.

Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide that the laws of the state designated by a health insurance issuer (primary state) apply to individual health insurance coverage offered by that issuer in the primary state and in any other state (secondary state), but only if the coverage and issuer comply with the conditions of this Act.

Exempts issuers from any secondary state's laws that would prohibit or regulate the operation of the issuer in that state, subject to certain restrictions imposed by that state.

 Gives sole jurisdiction to the primary state to enforce the primary state's covered laws in the primary state and any secondary state.

Requires the Government Accountability Office to study the effect of this Act on specified health insurance issues.</summary>
