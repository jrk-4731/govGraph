This bill requires the President's annual budget to include additional details regarding current spending levels and proposed increases.

The budget must include: (1) a list of programs and funding levels that will be a one-time expense for the year for which the budget is submitted, and (2) a proposal for reducing spending in each of the four years following the year for which the budget is submitted.

For each item in the budget that is being conducted in the current year, the budget must include: the funding provided in the current year, any proposed change in the funding, and the justification for the change. If the budget proposes an increase in funding for an item, it must also include the amount of the adjustment that is due to inflation and increases in employee salaries or benefits.

The budget must also include estimates for funding that would be included in the budget for the following year if programs and activities received the same amount of funding as provided in the current year.</summary>
