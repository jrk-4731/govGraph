  <summary date="2015-06-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act or the LADDER Act

This bill: (1) prohibits employers from entering into not to compete covenants with low-wage employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, and (2) requires an employer of such employees to post notice of such prohibition in a conspicuous place on the employer's premises.

The bill defines "low-wage employee" as an employee who earns less than the greater of $15 per hour or the state or local minimum wage.

In order for an employer to require such an employee who is not a low-wage employee to enter into such a covenant, the employer must have disclosed the requirement for entering into such covenant before hiring such employee.

The Secretary of Labor shall: (1) enforce a complaint of a violation of this Act in the same manner as a complaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and (2) impose a civil fine on any employer who violates this Act.</summary>
