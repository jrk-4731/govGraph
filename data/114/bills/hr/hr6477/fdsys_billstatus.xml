For purposes of these denials of immunity, the court must determine that the activity associated with the exhibition or display is commercial and that determination must be necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the foreign state.</p> <p>The Department of State must ensure that foreign states that apply for such temporary exhibition immunity are notified of the amendments made by this bill.</p>]]></text>
