  <summary date="2016-06-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Personalize Your Care Act 2.0

This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to&#160;establish&#160;several new programs and&#160;requirements related to end-of-life care and advance care planning.

The bill establishes a demonstration program to test the use of advanced illness management and early use of palliative care under Medicare.

The&#160;Department of Health and&#160;Human Services (HHS)&#160;must make grants to eligible entities for the purpose of developing, expanding, and enhancing programs for orders for life-sustaining treatment.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&#160;(CMS) shall adopt standards for electronic health records with respect to providing one-click access to specified advance care planning documentation.

Under Medicare,&#160;an advance directive shall be portable across state lines and may be presumed valid regardless of where it was executed. In the absence of a validly executed advance directive, any authentic expression of a person's wishes with regard to health care&#160;shall be honored.

The Government Accountability Office must&#160;study and report on&#160;the portability, electronic storage, use, and barriers to use of advance directives.

The bill applies specified quality measures to end-of-life care under Medicare.

CMS must report annually on specified information related to Medicare decedents.

HHS shall award grants to increase public awareness of advance care planning. In addition, HHS&#160;shall award grants to eligible entities for the development and implementation of training and education programs related to advance care planning, hospice care, and palliative care.

HHS must establish an advisory committee on advance care planning.</summary>
