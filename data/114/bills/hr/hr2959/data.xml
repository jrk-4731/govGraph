(Sec. 2) This bill amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to set a limit on nongovernmental third-party contributions counted as qualified state expenditures used in determining whether a state maintains a certain level of historic state expenditures or else faces an associated penalty with a reduction in the state TANF grant.

Qualified state expenditures shall exclude:

 the amount (if any) by which the value of all goods and services provided by a source other than the state or a local government during the fiscal year exceeds the value of all goods and services claimed by the state as qualified state expenditures for FY2016, and any amount expended for medical services.</summary>
