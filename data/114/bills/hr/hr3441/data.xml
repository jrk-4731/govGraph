  <summary date="2015-08-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Accurate Education for Prenatal Screenings Act

Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop, implement, and maintain two programs, one to educate patients and one to educate health care providers regarding:

 the purposes and definitions of cell-free DNA prenatal screenings; the reasons for patients and providers to consider such screenings; the conditions such screenings may detect; the risks and benefits of, and alternatives to, the various methods of administering such screenings and prenatal diagnostic testing; the possible results of such screenings and the accuracy of such results; the need for diagnostic testing, and counseling by a genetics professional, for patients whose screenings yield positive, abnormal, or indeterminate results; and the need for communication of results to patients and appropriate follow-up per guidelines established by medical professional societies. Requires each program to provide materials that:

 contain information that is peer-reviewed, balanced, accurate, and up-to-date; enable the respective target audience to understand the available options with regard to such screenings, other prenatal screenings, and diagnostic tests; promote the informed consent of, and enhance the decision-making processes of, the respective target audience before and after such screenings; contain information that appropriately addresses the diversity of the patient population; and contain contact information for relevant services and support organizations for patients. Requires CDC to submit annual reports regarding:

 the development and implementation of such programs; the accessibility of each program to, and the adoption of each program by, its respective target audience; and CDC's efforts to ensure that providers and patients receive the materials created pursuant to this Act.</summary>
