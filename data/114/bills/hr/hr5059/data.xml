This bill amends the definition of a veteran's "surviving spouse," for the purpose of veterans benefits provisions, to eliminate the requirement that such person: (1) has not remarried; or (2) has not, since the death of the veteran and after September 19, 1962, lived with another person and held himself or herself out to be the other person's spouse.

The effective date of an award of specified veterans benefits to a surviving spouse based upon termination of a remarriage by death or divorce occurring before the date of enactment of this bill shall be the date of death, or the date the judicial decree or divorce becomes final, if an application therefor is received within one year of the remarriage's termination.</summary>
