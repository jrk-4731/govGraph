  <summary date="2015-01-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">American Indian Empowerment Act of 2015

 Requires the Secretary of the Interior to transfer land the federal government holds in trust for a federally recognized Indian tribe to such tribe as restricted fee tribal land, subject to a restriction against alienation and taxation, after receiving the Indian tribe's request for such transfer. (Restricted fee tribal land is land to which a tribe holds legal title, but which carries legal restrictions against alienation or encumbrance.)

Allows Indian tribes to lease, or grant an easement or right-of-way on, restricted fee tribal land for any period of time without the Secretary's review and approval.

Gives the laws of a federally recognized Indian tribe that establish a system of land tenure governing the use of the land the tribe holds precedence over any federal law or regulation governing the use of such land, excepting a federal restriction against its alienation and taxation.</summary>
