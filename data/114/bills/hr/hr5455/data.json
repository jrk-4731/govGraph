The CFPB may gather information only on a sampling basis.\n\nThe bill repeals CFPB authority to gather and compile information from examination reports concerning covered persons or service providers. It also prohibits the CFPB from using its authorities to obtain records from covered persons and service providers participating in consumer financial services markets for purposes of assessing their compliance with the requirements of federal consumer financial law.\n\nThe bill also repeals the CFPB:\n\n mandate to require reports and conduct periodic examinations of nondepository covered persons for purposes of detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services, exclusive authority and mandate to require reports and conduct periodic examinations for the same purposes of insured depository institutions and insured credit unions with over $10 billion in assets (and their affiliates), and authority to require reports and conduct periodic examinations for the same purposes of insured depository institutions and insured credit unions with $10 billion or less in assets."
