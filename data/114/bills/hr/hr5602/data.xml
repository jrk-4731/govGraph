  <summary date="2016-12-10T20:21:16Z" status="Passed Senate amended">TITLE I--ENHANCING ANTITERRORISM TOOLS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

(Sec. 101) This bill revises the authority of the Department of the Treasury to issue an order imposing recordkeeping and reporting requirements upon financial institutions and nonfinancial trade or business groups in certain geographic areas regarding transactions for the payment, receipt, or transfer of U.S. coins or currency (or other monetary instruments as Treasury may describe in an order).

A Treasury order for recordkeeping and reporting may include all funds (not just U.S. coins or currency) involved in such transactions.

(Sec. 102) To improve the tracking of cross-border fund transfers and identify forms of terrorist financing, Treasury must report on: (1) the efficacy of requiring banking regulators to establish a pilot program to provide technical assistance to depository institutions and credit unions that wish to provide account services to money services businesses serving individuals in Somalia; (2) whether the pilot program could improve the ability of U.S. persons to make legitimate funds transfers through transparent monitored channels while complying with the Bank Secrecy Act and controls aimed at stopping money laundering and the financing of terrorism; and (3) information sharing mechanisms for depository institutions and credit unions to understand whether an individual money services business is meeting its obligations to combat illicit finance.

(Sec. 103) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes should help foreign partners integrate intelligence analytic capacities with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes.

(Sec. 104) Treasury must report on the role of its financial attaches and technical advisors at U.S. embassies and their resources to assist in countering terrorist financing and money laundering.

TITLE II--NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR COMBATING TERRORIST AND OTHER ILLICIT FINANCING

(Sec. 201) Treasury must develop a national strategy with priorities to combat terrorist financing and prevent illicit finance activities within and transiting the U.S. financial system. The strategy must: (1) identify the most significant threats, (2) coordinate enforcement efforts at all levels of government and with international partners, and (3) describe efforts to ensure that data collected by the federal government is available in a timely fashion to agencies and appropriate financial institutions and that agencies make use of publicly available data.</summary>
