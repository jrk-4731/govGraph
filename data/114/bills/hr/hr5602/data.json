The strategy must: (1) identify the most significant threats, (2) coordinate enforcement efforts at all levels of government and with international partners, and (3) describe efforts to ensure that data collected by the federal government is available in a timely fashion to agencies and appropriate financial institutions and that agencies make use of publicly available data."
