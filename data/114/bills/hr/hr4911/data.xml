  <summary date="2016-04-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Drone Operator Safety Act

This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime to operate an unmanned aircraft (i.e., drone) that knowingly or recklessly interferes with or disrupts the operation of an aircraft carrying one or more occupants in U.S. airspace.

The prohibition includes the operation of an unmanned aircraft within the runway exclusion zone (i.e., defined area of controlled airspace around an active runway) of an airport without approval.

A violator is subject to a fine, a prison term, or both.</summary>
