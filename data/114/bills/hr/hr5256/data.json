CBP shall increase the numbers of CBP officers and Agriculture Specialists for each of FY2017-FY2018.\n\nThe bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish within CBP the Immigration Cooperation Program, under which CBP may cooperate with foreign authorities, air carriers, and security employees at foreign airports to identify persons who may be inadmissible to the United States or otherwise pose a risk to U.S. security.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall review and report on the adequacy and appropriateness of the security screening process for each U.S. nonimmigrant visa category."
