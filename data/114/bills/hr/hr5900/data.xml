  <summary date="2016-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2016

This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a final rule relating to flame mitigation devices in portable fuel containers for flammable liquid fuels that sufficiently reduces the risk of injuries associated with the tendency of vapors igniting when the container is near an open flame or other ignition source. A "portable fuel container" is defined as a receptacle for flammable liquids (including any spout, retrofit spout, cap, and other closure mechanism and component of such receptacle) that foreseeably will be used by consumers and is manufactured or imported for use in the United States.

The rule must be treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act.</summary>
