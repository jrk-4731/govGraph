This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend until December 31, 2017, the suspension of employment and railroad retirement taxes for employers who hire unemployed individuals.&#160; The aggregate reduction in taxes from such suspension is limited to $5,000 per employee.

The bill modifies the unemployment requirement to require a signed affidavit from the unemployed individual that, during the entire 27-week period ending on the hiring date, such individual: (1) was receiving federal or state unemployment compensation, or (2) was unemployed and would have received unemployment compensation except for having exhausted the right to receive such compensation during such period.</summary>
