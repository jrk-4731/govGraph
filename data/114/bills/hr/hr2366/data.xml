  <summary date="2015-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Field EMS Modernization and Innovation Act

This bill amends part A (General Provisions) of title XI of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to require the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to evaluate the implementation and reimbursement under Medicare of field EMS (emergency medical response and medical care provided outside of a medical facility) other than transportation to the nearest appropriate medical facility.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) must: (1) promote innovative payment models for field EMS, (2) develop and evaluate innovative models of field EMS delivery and reimbursement, and (3) pay providers and suppliers of ground ambulance services for reporting certain quality measures.

The SSA may establish for field EMS an innovative payment model that has been sufficiently demonstrated.

The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) is amended to require the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to: (1) award grants to improve field EMS agency readiness and for field EMS education programs, (2) promote medical oversight of field EMS, (3) make recommendations for improving collection and use of field EMS data that the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) must implement, and (4) develop and implement a national emergency medical services strategy to improve patient outcomes in the field and support value-based emergency medical care.

Patient safety improvement activities are expanded to include field EMS agencies, medical directors, and emergency medical technicians.

Responsibility for the National EMS Information System is transferred from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to the ONC.

Emergency medical service providers are health care providers for purposes of title XXX (Health Information Technology and Quality) of the PHSA.

HHS is responsible for improving the emergency medical care system and field EMS.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality must conduct or support field EMS research.

Federal field EMS research may be used to determine Medicare coverage.

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the Emergency Medical Services Trust Fund and allow individuals to contribute to the fund when filing a tax return.</summary>
