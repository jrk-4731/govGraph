  <summary date="2016-05-11T13:34:19Z" status="Passed House amended">Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill permits the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a grant program to support prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs, such as naloxone, for patients at an elevated risk of overdose, including patients prescribed an opioid. (Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.)

Grant recipients may use the funds to purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs, establish a program for prescribing such drugs, train health care providers and pharmacists, track patients and outcomes, offset patient cost sharing, conduct community outreach, and connect patients to treatment.

(Sec. 3) HHS may provide information to prescribers in federally qualified health centers and Indian Health Service facilities on best practices for prescribing opioid overdose reversal drugs for patients at an elevated risk of overdose.

(Sec. 4) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to reduce, as an offset, the authorization of appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities for FY2018.</summary>
