This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit federal enforcement of marijuana offenses in a state that: (1) requests a waiver from the Department of Justice (DOJ) certifying that it legalized marijuana; (2) demonstrates a regulatory scheme sufficient to protect federal interests (e.g., preventing marijuana distribution to minors); and (3) agrees to study and report on certain outcomes.

DOJ may revoke the waiver of a state that fails to meets the conditions.
