The TVA may levy necessary and reasonable fees on the owners of such cabins.\n\nThe TVA may not require removal of floating cabins located on TVA waters on the date of enactment of this bill for specified periods after enactment of this bill and must allow continued use of such cabins that meet the requirements of this bill for the duration of such periods."
