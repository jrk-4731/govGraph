This bill revises the statutory debt limit to: (1) apply the limit only to debt held by the public, and (2) require annual adjustments to the limit to account for increases in the gross domestic product.

(Under current law, the debt limit applies to debt held by the public and debt held by government accounts. Debt held by the public consists mainly of securities issued by the Treasury and held by investors. Debt held by the government is debt issued to the federal government's trust funds for programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and military and civil service retirement benefits.)</summary>
