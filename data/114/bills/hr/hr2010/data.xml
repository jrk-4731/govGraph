  <summary date="2015-04-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Regulatory Review and Sunset Act of 2015

 Requires federal agencies to review their covered rules and modify, consolidate, or terminate such rules on a periodic basis. Defines "covered rule" to include a significant rule that is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or any other rule designated by an agency or the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management and Budget for sunset review.

Allows a person adversely affected by a rule that is not a significant rule to submit a public petition for sunset review of such rule. Provides for sunset review of a rule upon the request of a congressional committee or a majority of the members of such committee.

Requires the OIRA to: (1) conduct an inventory of existing rules and deadlines for their sunset review; (2) prioritize rules for sunset review based on specified criteria, including the cost of the rule and the burden of reviewing it; (3) group related rules for simultaneous sunset review; (4) provide guidance to agencies for conducting sunset reviews; and (5) provide feedback to agencies on sunset reviews and results.

Sets forth review deadlines for existing and new significant rules.

Requires each agency to designate a Regulatory Review Officer with responsibility for implementation of this Act.

Provides for judicial review of a denial or substantial inexcusable delay in granting or denying a public petition for sunset review of a rule.

Terminates this Act 10 years after its enactment.</summary>
