        <description>Amendment sought to remove language in the bill which allows the Secretary to increase the Federal share of costs above 80 percent for projects in rural areas so as to put all transportation projects on an even playing field and allow all qualified projects to fairly compete for TIGER grants, regardless of whether they take place in an urban area or a rural area.</description>
