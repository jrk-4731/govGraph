  <summary date="2015-05-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Veteran Wellness Act

 Requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a two-year pilot program under which the VA makes grants to nonprofit veterans services organizations (VSOs) to: (1) upgrade their community facilities into health and wellness centers in at least 10 different geographic locations, and (2) promote and expand complementary and integrative wellness programs.

Directs the VA to give priority to locations in economically depressed areas that are not in close proximity to VA medical centers.

Requires a VSO, as a condition of receiving a grant, to agree to carry out the operation and maintenance of a facility that is repaired or constructed using grant funds for three years after completion of the repair or construction.</summary>
