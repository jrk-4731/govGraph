This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S.-India defense partnership is vital to regional and international stability and security, and (2) the President should take action to formalize India's status as a U.S. major partner.

The President should coordinate with India annually to develop military contingency plans for addressing threats to mutual security interests.

The President shall: (1) annually assess the extent to which India possesses strategic operational capabilities to execute military operations of mutual interest to the United States and India; and (2) ensure that such assessment is used in reviewing applications to sell or export defense articles, defense services, or technical data.

The Arms Export Control Act is amended to extend special foreign military sales status to India.</summary>
