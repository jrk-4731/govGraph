  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Partnering to Detect and Defeat Tunnels Act

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is in the best interests of the United States to develop technology to detect and counter tunnels, and the best way to do this is to partner with other affected countries; and (2) Israel is facing serious threats posed by tunnels and should be the first U.S. partner in addressing this challenge.

The Secretary of Defense: (1) shall seek to enter into an agreement with Israel to partner in developing and deploying technologies to detect and counter tunnels, (2) may seek to enter into similar agreements with U.S. allies, and (3) shall report to Congress annually through 2020.</summary>
