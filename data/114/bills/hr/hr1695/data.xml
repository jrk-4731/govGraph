  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Parental Notification and Intervention Act of 2015

Prohibits any person or organization in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or who solicits or accepts federal funds, from performing, permitting facilities to be used to perform, or assisting in the performance of an abortion on an unemancipated minor under the age of 18 unless written notification of the requested abortion is provided to the parents of the minor. Establishes an exception under which notification is not required for a parent if the physician is presented with documentation showing that a court in the minor's state of residence has waived parental notification because there is clear and convincing evidence of physical abuse of the minor by such parent.

Requires compliance with: (1) a 96-hour waiting period after any required notice has been received by the parents, and (2) any injunction granted by a federal district court if a notified parent initiates a judicial intervention process to enjoin the abortion.

 Prescribes penalties of not more than a $100,000 fine and/or imprisonment for not more than one year for each willful violation.

Provides an exception from parental notification requirements if a physician (other than the physician with principal responsibility for making the decision to perform the abortion) determines that: (1) a medical emergency exists that would result in the minor's death if her condition were not immediately treated, even though the treatment may result in the death of her unborn child; (2) parental notification is not possible as a result of the emergency; and (3) certifications regarding compliance with such rules and the reasons upon which such determinations are based have been entered in the minor's medical records. Requires parental notification through certified mail or personal delivery. Defines "parent" to include any legal guardian of an unemancipated minor. Authorizes a notified parent to bring an action in federal court which shall enjoin the abortion: (1) until the court's judgment is final, or (2) permanently unless the court determines that granting such relief would be unlawful. Prohibits this Act from being construed to preempt any state law that establishes, implements, or continues in effect greater parental notification requirements or intervention rights regarding abortion.</summary>
