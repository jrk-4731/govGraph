The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may not condition grants on the inability of applicants to finance their projects.\n\nThe bill amends the Public Health Service Act by reauthorizing through FY2021 and revising the grant program for state offices of rural health, including by requiring HHS to make the grants, thus removing HHS' discretion to make them.\n\nHHS must report annually to Congress and each state office of rural health on rural hospitals' closures."
