This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income, for income tax purposes, distributions from certain tax-exempt retirement plans to a heath savings account in which an individual who is covered by a high deductible health care plan is participating (qualified HSA funding distribution). The bill also exempts such&#160;distributions from the 10% penalty for&#160;premature retirement plan distributions.</summary>
