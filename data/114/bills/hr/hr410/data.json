Authorizes a law enforcement agency to seek renewal of an order if it has probable cause to believe the individual continues to pose a threat.\n\nAmends the federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) the sale or disposition of a firearm or ammunition to anyone subject to such an order; and (2) any person subject to such an order from owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving any firearms."
