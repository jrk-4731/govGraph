  <summary date="2016-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Preserving HUD's Multifamily Field Offices Act of 2016

This bill prohibits the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from relocating to any core office of the Office of Multifamily Housing any asset management position (including any account executive, senior account executive, and troubled asset specialist position) that, as of this bill's enactment, is located at a non-core office of that Office.

"Core office" is defined as a regional hub office located in Atlanta, Chicago, Fort Worth, New York City, or San Francisco.

Upon the occurrence of a vacancy in any asset management position at any non-core office (including any vacancy in existence as of the date of enactment), HUD may newly hire an employee to fill that position only at the same non-core office.</summary>
