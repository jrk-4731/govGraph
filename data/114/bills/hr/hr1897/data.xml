  <summary date="2015-04-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to apply certain requirements for permits and leases for domestic livestock grazing on National Forest System lands issued by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) regardless of where located.

Requires the terms and conditions in a grazing permit or lease that has been waived to be continued under a new permit or lease until the Department of the Interior (respecting public lands) or USDA completes any environmental analysis and documentation for an allotment management plan required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and other applicable laws.

Allows the categorical exclusion of an allotment management plan by Interior or USDA from the requirement to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement under NEPA if: (1) the issued allotment management plan continues the current grazing management of the allotment, and (2) the Department concerned has assessed and evaluated the grazing allotment associated with such management plan.

(A "categorical exclusion" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is required.)</summary>
