This bill authorizes the Comptroller General to review the involvement of the American National Red Cross (the corporation) in any federal program or activity the corporation carries out (current law), including in connection with events for which the government provides leadership or support under the national preparedness system. For purposes of such review, the Comptroller General shall have: (1) access to and the right to examine and copy all corporation records the Comptroller General deems relevant, and (2) access to and the right to interview any corporation employee or volunteer the Comptroller General believes to have relevant knowledge.

The Comptroller General may: (1) subpoena a record or employee of the corporation, and (2) bring a civil action in U.S. district court for the District of Columbia to enforce compliance with such subpoena.

The corporation's Office of the Ombudsman must enhance dispute resolution regarding concerns raised by stakeholders regarding the corporation and regularly report to the corporation's board of governors information on trends and patterns on concerns communicated to the Office regarding the corporation. The Office must make information available on its website on how to submit concerns about the organization.

The bill requires audits, every three years, by: (1) the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration of the corporation's revenues, expenditures, and governance; (2) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General of the corporation's disaster assistance services; and (3) the U.S. Agency for International Development Inspector General of the corporation's international activities.
