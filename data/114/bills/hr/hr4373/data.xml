  <summary date="2016-01-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">End Drunk Driving Act of 2016

This bill directs the Department of Transportation to issue a final rule prescribing or amending a federal motor vehicle safety standard that would prevent operation of a motor vehicle when the operator is under the influence of alcohol.

Such standard shall:

 prevent the operation of the motor vehicle if the operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit; and require the technology to be reliable and accurate, set at the legal limit, unobtrusive and fast, tamper-proof/circumvention-resistent, functionary in extreme environments, and easily maintained. To meet grant requirements, a state must enact and enforce a law that requires the installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence.

The bill prescribes compliance requirements and penalties for noncompliance.</summary>
