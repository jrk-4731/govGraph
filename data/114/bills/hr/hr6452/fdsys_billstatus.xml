These conventions are designed to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources and marine ecosystems in the North Pacific and South Pacific Ocean of the United States. <p>The North Pacific Fisheries Commission and the Commission of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization were established by the North and South Pacific fishery conventions, respectively. The United States must be represented by five commissioners on the North Pacific commission and not more than three on the South Pacific commission. Additionally, permanent advisory committees are established to represent groups concerned with the fishery resources covered by each convention.</p> <p>The Department of State has certain authority and responsibilities with respect to both commissions.</p> <p>NOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard are required to administer and enforce this bill.</p> <p> This bill lists fishing and shipping activities that are prohibited in the North and South Pacific Ocean.</p> <p> The bill amends the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act to include commercial fishing as practical experience the President must consider when selecting a commissioner for the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. </p> <p><i>Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Amendments Act</i></p> <p>The bill reauthorizes and amends the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995. The Convention on Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, which was adopted in Lisbon on September 28, 2007, is implemented as well. Additionally, the bill repeals provisions requiring NOAA to establish and report a new fishing quota allocation practice in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.</p> <p>The bill also eliminates the requirement that NOAA annually provide Congress with a report of findings developed under NOAA's Oceans and Human Health Initiative which is a series of programs designed to enhance understanding between the oceans and human health.</p> </p>]]></text>
