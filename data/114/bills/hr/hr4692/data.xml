This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require hospitals, child care centers, clinics, and similar institutions caring for infants who are 28 days or less of age to administer to such infants a test for adrenoleukodystrophy, a progressive genetic disease that can cause behavioral changes, seizures, and other neurological symptoms.

To be eligible for funds under the Heritable Disorders Program, a state must establish adrenoleukodystrophy testing standards and procedures. These standards and procedures are subject to review and approval by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. The committee must establish standards and procedures for states without approved standards and procedures.</summary>
