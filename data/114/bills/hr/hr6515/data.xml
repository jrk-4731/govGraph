This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to specify that a&#160;certain Medicare rule for counting resident time in nonprovider settings shall not be applied in a manner that requires the&#160;reopening of any settled hospital cost reports except where there was a jurisdictionally proper appeal pending as of March 23, 2010. The bill applies retroactively.</summary>
