This bill requires the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to prescribe regulations to permit continued participation in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) by a member of the uniformed services after such member's discharge or release from service if such individual is entitled to veterans disability compensation.

For purposes of provisions regarding TSP contributions, such individual's monthly veterans disability compensation shall be deemed to be his or her basic pay for a monthly pay period, but such individual's contribution shall not require or authorize a matching government contribution.</summary>
