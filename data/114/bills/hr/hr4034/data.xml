  <summary date="2015-11-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Secure Fence Restoration Act of 2015

This bill amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 with respect to construction of border fencing and road improvements to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to complete the required 700-mile southwest border fencing and priority-area fencing by December 31, 2017.

The Secure Fence Act of 2006 is amended to direct DHS, in consultation with state and local officials along the U.S.-Mexico border, to achieve operational control over U.S. international land and maritime borders by December 31, 2017.

National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act

Neither the Department of the Interior nor the Department of Agriculture may prohibit or restrict U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) activities on federal land under their respective jurisdictions within 100 miles of an international land border to:

 execute search and rescue operations; and prevent unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband through such border. CBP shall have access to such lands to conduct: (1) road and barrier construction and maintenance, (2) vehicular patrols, (3) surveillance activities, and (4) deployment of temporary tactical infrastructure.</summary>
