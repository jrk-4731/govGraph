  <summary date="2015-12-18T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Synchronization &amp; Nonadherence Correction (SYNC) Act of 2015

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to research and test methods for improving medication adherence. "Medication adherence" refers to the taking of medications according to their prescribed dosage, time, frequency, and direction.

Research activities shall include the development of annual statistics related to&#160;medication adherence for patients with chronic diseases and mental health conditions treated under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program.

HHS shall implement innovative health care delivery models to test: (1) the efficacy of "synchronization," which refers to the coordination of medication refills such that a patient's medications are refilled&#160;according to&#160;the same schedule; and (2) 90-day fills at retail pharmacies for the first prescription of&#160;maintenance drugs that treat chronic diseases and mental health conditions.</summary>
