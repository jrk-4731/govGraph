  <summary date="2015-05-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Emerging Business Encouragement Act of 2015

 Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), for each industry category for which the Administrator established a size standard, to establish procedures, by rule, for designating a small business in that industry category as an emerging business enterprise (EBE).

Requires the designation to expire when the small business is no longer in compliance with the criteria, except that:

 in the case of an EBE which existed as a business entity before its EBE designation, the designation shall not expire until five years after it was made; and if the EBE exceeds the required size limitation its designation shall expire only if the size is 50% or more of the maximum size of a small business within that industry category. Directs the Administrator to establish specified criteria for designation of an EBE.

Requires the head of each federal agency to establish goals for participation by the designated EBEs in at least 5% of all contracts, including prime contracts and subcontracts, for each fiscal year.

Authorizes the Administrator to make a loan to a designated EBE under the SBA Express Loan Program, but only in accordance with specified terms.

Requires the Administrator, by rule, to establish a process for initial self-certification of EBEs for purposes of participation in federal contracts and eligibility for the Express Loans.</summary>
