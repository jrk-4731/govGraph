  <summary date="2016-04-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No Defense Contracts for Terror Profiteers Act of 2016

This bill prohibits funds available to the Department of Defense (DOD) for FY2017 from being used to procure, or enter into a contract to procure, goods or services from any person that provides material support to a covered Iranian person during such fiscal year.

 A "covered Iranian person" includes an Iranian person that is: (1) included on the list of designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury for acting on behalf of, or being owned or controlled by, the government of Iran; or (2) owned or controlled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.

The bill requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to be revised to require a person with a prospective contract of more than $100,000 to certify that the person does not engage in prohibited conduct with a covered Iranian person.

DOD may, on a case-by-case basis, waive such prohibition for national security reasons but must provide Congress with notice before the waiver takes effect.</summary>
