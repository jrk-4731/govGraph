  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Patient Empowerment Act of 2015

 Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to allow any Medicare beneficiary to enter into a contract with an eligible professional (regardless of whether a participating or non-participating physician or practitioner) for any item or service covered by Medicare. Allows such beneficiaries to submit a claim for Medicare payment in the amount that would otherwise apply, except that where the professional is considered to be non-participating, payment shall be paid as if the professional were participating.

Defines eligible professional as a physician, a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, a certified nurse-midwife, a clinical social worker, a clinical psychologist, a clinical psychologist, a physical or or occupational therapist or a qualified speech-language pathologist, or a qualified audiologist.

Requires a Medicare beneficiary to agree in writing in such a contract to: (1) pay the eligible professional for a Medicare-covered item or service; and (2) submit (in lieu of the eligible professional) a claim for Medicare payment. Allows a beneficiary, however, to negotiate, as a term of the contract, for the eligible professional to file such claims on the beneficiary's behalf.

Preempts state laws from limiting the amount of charges for physician and practitioner services for which Medicare payment is made.</summary>
