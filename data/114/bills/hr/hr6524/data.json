Program purposes are listed, including:\n\n addressing the management, development, conservation, and use of water resources throughout the basin; coordinating restoration and protection activities; carrying out coordinated restoration and protection activities and providing technical assistance throughout the basin states; maintaining an inventory of historic and cultural resources of the basin and identifying projects to provide for cultural enrichment, preservation of cultural resources, public education about local heritage and historical significance of properties, canals, and historic sites within the basin; and providing a mechanism to promote communication, coordination, and collaborative working relationships among entities working in the basin. Interior shall develop criteria to ensure that activities funded through the grant program accomplish identified purposes and advance the implementation of priority actions or needs identified in the basin-wide strategy."
