  <summary date="2015-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Intern Protection Act

Prohibits certain employers from refusing to employ, discriminating against, or harassing interns because of age, race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, military status, disability, gender identity, predisposing genetic characteristics, marital status, or status as a victim of domestic violence.

Bars employers from compelling a pregnant intern to take a leave of absence, unless the intern is prevented by such pregnancy from performing internship activities in a reasonable manner.

Prohibits employers from engaging in certain unwelcome sexual advances or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature to an intern when: (1) submission is a condition for continuing the internship or a basis for employment decisions; or (2) the conduct unreasonably interferes with work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

Makes the age discrimination prohibitions of this Act applicable only to individuals who are at least 40 years of age.

Authorizes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Librarian of Congress, the Board of Directors of Congress's Office of Compliance, the Department of Justice, the President, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and U.S. courts to enforce this Act under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, and other laws granting rights and protections to certain applicants and employees.</summary>
