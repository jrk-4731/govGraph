This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that payments to plans do not exceed payments to HHS under the risk corridors program (under which a qualified health plan is required to participate in a payment adjustment system based on the ratio of the allowable costs of the plan to the plan's aggregate premiums) for a plan year.

HHS must proportionately decrease payments to plans in order to ensure that this requirement is satisfied each year.</summary>
