This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit of $1,500 for hiring&#160;an apprenticeship employee&#160;who has not attained age 25&#160;at the close of the taxable year or $1,000 for hiring an apprenticeship employee&#160;who has attained age 25. The credit is available for no more than&#160;two taxable years with respect to any apprenticeship employee.

An "apprenticeship employee" means any employee who is: (1) a party to an apprenticeship agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor or a recognized state apprenticeship agency; and (2) employed by the employer in the occupation identified in the apprenticeship agreement, whether or not the employer is a party to such agreement.</summary>
