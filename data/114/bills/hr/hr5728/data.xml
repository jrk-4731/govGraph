  <summary date="2016-07-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cuban Airport Security Act of 2016

This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to report to Congress on specified aspects of security measures at each of Cuba's 10 international airports. The Government Accountability Office shall submit to Congress an audit of the report.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall establish agreements with the Government of Cuba to allow:

 the Federal Air Marshal Service to conduct missions on regularly scheduled passenger air flights between the United States and Cuba, and TSA inspectors to access all areas of last point of departure airports in Cuba to assess security. No agreement, dated on or after January 1, 2016, to expand air flights between the United States and Cuba may be permitted until the report and audit have been submitted and the agreements have been established.

DHS (currently, the Department of Transportation [DOT]) shall assess the effectiveness of security standards at foreign airports and take other appropriate actions for those airports not maintaining effective security measures, including requesting DOT to suspend, without notice or a hearing, the right of an air carrier or foreign air carrier to provide foreign air transportation if passenger safety or security is threatened and the public interest requires an immediate suspension.</summary>
