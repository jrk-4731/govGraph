No agreement, dated on or after January 1, 2016, to expand air flights between the United States and Cuba may be permitted until the report and audit have been submitted and the agreements have been established.\n\nDHS (currently, the Department of Transportation [DOT]) shall assess the effectiveness of security standards at foreign airports and take other appropriate actions for those airports not maintaining effective security measures, including requesting DOT to suspend, without notice or a hearing, the right of an air carrier or foreign air carrier to provide foreign air transportation if passenger safety or security is threatened and the public interest requires an immediate suspension."
