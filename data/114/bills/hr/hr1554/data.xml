Elkhorn Ranch and White River National Forest Conveyance Act of 2015

 (Sec. 2) This bill requires all interest of the United States in 148 acres of identified land shall be conveyed by patent to the Gordman-Leverich Partnership (GLP), a Colorado Limited Liability Partnership.

 The conveyance: (1) is subject to the valid existing rights of the lessee of federal oil and gas lease COC-75070 and any other valid existing rights, and (2) shall reserve to the United States the right to collect rent and royalty payments on such lease for its duration.

 The conveyance does not modify the exterior boundary of the White River National Forest in Colorado nor the boundaries of Sections 18 and 19 of a certain Township in Colorado, as such boundaries are in effect on the date of enactment of this Act.

 The conveyance shall: (1) be completed by no later than 180 days of enactment of this Act; and (2) be without consideration, except that all costs incurred by the Department of the Interior relating to any survey, platting, legal description, or other activities carried out to prepare and issue the patent shall be paid by GLP to Interior prior to the conveyance of such land.</summary>
