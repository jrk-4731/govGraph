  <summary date="2016-12-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Postage Free Ballot Act

Any absentee ballot for any election shall be carried through the mail expeditiously and free of charge.

This bill amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to direct a state to use a requirements payment to reimburse the U.S. Postal Service for revenue it would have obtained from the mailing of absentee ballots but for the requirement that such ballots be mailed for free.</summary>
