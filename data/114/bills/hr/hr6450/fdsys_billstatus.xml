          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to exempt inspectors general (when they are conducting an authorized audit, investigation, inspection, evaluation, or review) from: (1) information privacy protections that require agreements between agencies for computerized comparisons of automated federal records systems under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, and (2) procedural requirements for information collections under the Paperwork Reduction Act.</p> <p>The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) must mediate disputes that involve the jurisdiction of more than one office of inspector general, except for matters coordinated by intelligence community inspectors general.</p> <p>The membership structure of CIGIE's Integrity Committee is modified to eliminate: (1) the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as chairperson of the committee, and (2) the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) as a committee member. The committee must elect one of the inspectors general on the committee as chairperson to serve for a term of two years. </p> <p>The bill revises procedures and establishes time lines for the committee to refer allegations of wrongdoing against an inspector general, or against a staff member of an inspector general's office, to: (1) the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the OSC for investigation, or (2) the committee for review. Concurrent investigations may be conducted by the committee, DOJ, and the OSC.
