Physical presence does not include: (1) certain referral agreements, (2) presence for less than 15 days in a year, (3) delivery and product placement services offered by an interstate or in-state common carrier, or (4) Internet advertising services provided by in-state residents which are not exclusively directed towards or exclusively soliciting in-state customers.\n\nThe bill specifies that U.S. district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce this bill."
