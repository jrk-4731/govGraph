The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nPower And Security Systems (PASS) Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to revise energy conservation standards (i.e., no-load mode standards for devices operating in standby) for external power supplies (EPSs) designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system component, such as smoke alarms that have to remain powered at all times.\n\nCurrent law exempts EPSs of security or life safety systems from those standards until July 1, 2017. This bill extends that exemption until July 1, 2023. The Department of Energy (DOE) must decide by July 1, 2021, whether standards for those EPSs should be amended further. In the rule, DOE may treat such EPSs as a separate class with different standards or may extend the exemption."
