  <summary date="2015-02-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fixing Operations of Reservoirs to Encompass Climatic and Atmospheric Science Trends Act or the FORECAST Act 

Requires the Secretary of the Army, not later than one year after a request of a nonfederal sponsor of a reservoir, to review operation of such reservoir, including the water control manual and rule curves, using improved weather forecasts and run-off forecasting methods, including the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System of the National Weather Service and the Hydrometeorology Testbed program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Requires the Secretary to determine if a change in operations will improve core functions of the Army Corps of Engineers, including: (1) reducing risks to human life, public safety, and property; (2) reducing the need for future disaster relief; (3) improving local water storage capability and reliability in coordination with the nonfederal sponsor and other water users; (4) restoring, protecting, or mitigating the impacts of a water resources development project on the environment; or (5) improving fish species habitat or population within the boundaries and downstream of a water resources project.

Requires that if the Secretary determines from results of the review that using improved weather and run-off forecasting methods improves one or more core functions of the Corps at a reservoir, the Secretary shall incorporate such changes in its operation and update the water control manual.</summary>
