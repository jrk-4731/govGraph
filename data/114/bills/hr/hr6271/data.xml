The tour of duty or period of assignment shall be between four and six years for: (1) a member of the Armed Forces serving as a defense attache, or (2) a civilian employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assigned to a Defense Attache Office outside the United States.

The Department of Defense (DOD) may reduce a tour of duty or a period of assignment if: (1) it is at an unhealthful post, (2) it is the first tour of duty or first period of assignment, or (3) DOD determines such reduced tour to be appropriate for exigent circumstances.
