This bill directs the General Services Administration (GSA) to sell buildings owned by the federal government that are not utilized. GSA must identify all such buildings and sell them not later than five years after they have been identified. The bill exempts buildings that have been set aside for preservation or historic purposes.

The bill requires the net revenues from the sale of such buildings to be made available to increase the cost-of-living adjustments to: (1) social security retirement benefits, and (2) retirement benefits for members and former members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
