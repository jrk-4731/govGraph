This bill authorizes the President to provide technical and financial assistance for programs that: (1) improve Nepal's basic infrastructure following the earthquakes in affected communities; (2) support economic growth, including through agriculture and small-scale enterprise opportunities; (3) promote health and basic education programs; and (4) support democracy programs that promote political reforms, including strengthening democratic institutions and rule of law.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency may provide accelerated response in Nepal for:

 project identification and investment analyses; trade capacity building and sector development activities, including technical assistance and feasibility studies that support investments in infrastructure that contribute to overseas development; and trade capacity building and sector development assistance supporting the establishment of industry standards, market liberalization, and other policy reform, with a particular focus on engineering and construction. The U.S Agency for International Development shall report to Congress regarding:

 the effectiveness of U.S. investment in Nepal in disaster risk reduction and recovery program improvement; and the effectiveness of international humanitarian and reconstruction assistance provided to Nepal, and a related assessment of U.S. anti-corruption efforts. The Department of State shall report to Congress regarding impediments to Nepal's recovery efforts.</summary>
