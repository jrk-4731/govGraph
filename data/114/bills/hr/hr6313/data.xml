  <summary date="2016-11-14T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Providing Certainty for Progenitors Act of 2016 

This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime to have physical custody of a living human embryo and refuse to release the embryo for implantation in a willing implantee at the request of one of the progenitors of that embryo. A progenitor is an individual who provides an egg or a sperm cell from which an embryo is created.

A violator is subject to a fine, up to three months in prison, or both.

Additionally, the bill bars the criminal prosecution of a progenitor of an embryo that is not implanted.</summary>
