Act of 2016\n\nThis bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to states and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to support or develop programs that will train teachers, school personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel regarding mental health conditions in children.\n\nTo be\u00a0eligible to receive such a\u00a0grant or subgrant, a state or LEA must partner with a mental health organization, family advocacy organization, or community nonprofit organization.\n\nSubgrantees shall utilize school counselors, school psychologists, school social workers, or community organizations with experience in mental illness and suicide prevention to develop and conduct the training.\n\nThe training program must include an annual in-service training component that enables teachers, school personnel, and specialized instructional support personnel to: (1) better understand mental health conditions and the early warning signs in children and adolescents; (2) effectively communicate their mental health concerns with families and consider family perspectives; (3) identify classroom strategies for working effectively with troubled children; and (4) understand school-specific information, including links to mental health services and supports in the school and community.\n\nED shall\u00a0develop outcome measures for in-depth evaluation of the effectiveness of the training programs."
