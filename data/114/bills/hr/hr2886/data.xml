This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish:

 an Automated and Connected Vehicle Research Initiative for the broad scale adoption of automated vehicle technology, and a competitively selected Intelligent Transportation Systems Science &amp; Technology Center. The bill revises requirements for the university transportation centers program.

Each nonprofit institution of higher education (other than the lead nonprofit institution of higher education of a consortium of such institutions) may only submit to DOT one grant application per fiscal year to establish and operate a national, regional, or tier one university transportation center.

The Office of Science and Technology Policy of the Executive Office of the President shall convene an interagency working group to assist DOT in implementing a strategic research and development plan for DOT transportation research programs.

The bill reauthorizes, and revises requirements for, the technology and accelerated innovation deployment program.

In carrying out such program, DOT shall:

 establish workshops to promote innovations in highway transportation; and provide assistance in establishing regional, state, and local technology needs, such as through frameworks developed in the National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 750. Certain amounts of a state's apportionment of federal-aid highway funds for state transportation planning and research shall be available for:

 travel for research and technology, and activities and training related to developing a culture of innovation and adoption of innovative technologies with respect to highway programs. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics shall establish:

 a Travel Data Initiative, and a pilot program to evaluate freight data collection and reporting measures. DOT shall establish a national cooperative freight transportation research program.

The bill reauthorizes, and revises requirements for, the program for commercial remote sensing products and spatial information technologies.</summary>
