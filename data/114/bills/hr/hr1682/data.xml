 Establishes a National Jazz Preservation Program and a National Jazz Appreciation Program, to be carried out by the Smithsonian Institution through the National Museum of American History, to: (1) preserve knowledge and promote education about jazz, and (2) further the appreciation of jazz music throughout the nation.

Requires the Smithsonian Institution to: (1) record audio and video interviews with leading jazz artists; (2) acquire, preserve, and interpret jazz artifacts; (3) continue to recognize Jazz Appreciation Month; (4) establish collaborative agreements with specified entities for the sharing of such artifacts; and (5) encourage, consult with, and engage in capacity building with community-based and regional organizations with the potential to establish jazz archival collections.

Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow certain funds to be made available under the Act for programs to promote jazz education, which may include: (1) a Jazz Artists in the Schools program; (2) a program for the development of lesson plans and other educational materials about jazz, the distribution of such materials, and teacher training on jazz education; and (3) an Ambassadors of Jazz program.

Requires the Smithsonian Institution to establish a series of jazz performances at Smithsonian affiliates throughout the nation that provides broad geographic access to jazz and supports public appreciation for the diversity of jazz music.</summary>
