(The JCPA is the agreement reached by China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, and Iran to ensure that Iran's nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful).\n\nThe report shall include matters relating to:\n\n Iran's space and ballistic missile programs; overlapping Russia-Iran interests in Latin America; the intelligence-sharing center established by Iran, Russia, and Syria in Baghdad, Iraq; naval cooperation between Iran and Russia and the long-term consequences of Russia's naval presence in the Eastern Mediterranean and Iran's naval presence in the Persian Gulf; how cooperation between Iran and Russian has increased with respect to the JCPA; the likelihood of Iran adopting the Russian model of hybrid warfare against potential targets such as the Gulf Cooperation Council states; Russian cooperation with Hezbollah in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq; and a list of weapons the sale of which by Russia to Iran would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions imposing an arms embargo on Iran."
