  <summary date="2016-02-11T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">SNAP Empowerment and Accountability Act of 2016 

This bill amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to permit states to use drug test results for determining eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must award grants to states to treat individuals who test positive.

The bill increases from $20 to $50 the amount of annual benefits received under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 or a similar energy assistance program which qualifies a SNAP applicant to use a standard utility allowance to document heating and cooling costs for calculating benefits.</summary>
