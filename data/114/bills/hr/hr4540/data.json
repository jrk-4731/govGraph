The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must award grants to states to treat individuals who test positive.\n\nThe bill increases from $20 to $50 the amount of annual benefits received under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 or a similar energy assistance program which qualifies a SNAP applicant to use a standard utility allowance to document heating and cooling costs for calculating benefits."
