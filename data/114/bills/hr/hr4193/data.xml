  <summary date="2015-12-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the licensee for the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] project number 2743) to occupy up to 20 acres of federal land to construct, operate, and maintain the Upper Hidden Basin Diversion Expansion without further authorization of the Department of the Interior or under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.

This is the expansion of the Terror Lake Hydroelectric Project described in the Upper Hidden Basin Grant Application dated July 2, 2014, as submitted by Kodiak Electric Association, Inc., to the Alaska Energy Authority Renewable Energy Fund Round VIII.

The Expansion must meet the terms and conditions contained in any amendment to a license which may be issued by FERC subsequent to its environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.</summary>
