This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow corporate taxpayers to elect a tax deduction for cash dividends received from a controlled foreign corporation during the period beginning after the bill's enactment date and ending on December 31, 2016. The dividends received are subject to an effective tax rate of 5.25% when repatriated in the United States.

The bill divides tax revenues attributable to such repatriated earnings equally for: (1) federal debt reduction, (2) transfers to the Highway Trust Fund, and (3) adjustments to limitations on defense discretionary spending.</summary>
