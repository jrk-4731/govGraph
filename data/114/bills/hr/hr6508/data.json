    "date": "2016-12-08T05:00:00Z", 
    "text": "Preventing Preventable Earthquakes Act\n\nThis bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring regulations for state underground injection programs to include provisions designed to prevent the occurrence of seismicity induced by underground injection activities.\n\nThe bill redefines \"underground injection\" to include the subsurface emplacement of fluids or propping agents pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations. Hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) is a process to extract underground resources such as oil or gas from a geologic formation by injecting water, a propping agent (e.g., sand), and chemical additives into a well under enough pressure to fracture the geological formation.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency must review approved state underground injection programs at least once every five years."
