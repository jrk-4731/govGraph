  <summary date="2015-03-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Physician Availability Act of 2015

Requires each covered hospital to have a qualified physician available in the hospital at all times to attend to the needs of the hospital's inpatients. Defines a "covered hospital" to: (1) include hospitals participating in Medicare or Medicaid or receiving federal funds, and (2) exclude hospitals in a federal facility or hospitals that the Department of Health and Human Services determines have fewer than 100 licensed beds.

 Considers a physician to be available if: (1) the physician is physically present in the hospital; (2) the physician's primary responsibility is to be in attendance to serve the needs of the hospital's inpatients without delay; and (3) the physician is not physically present in, assigned to, serving in, or expected to cover the hospital's emergency room or emergency department.

Sets forth penalties for violations.</summary>
