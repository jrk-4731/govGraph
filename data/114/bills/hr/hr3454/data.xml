This bill amends the Clean Air Act to allow the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to waive fuel mandates if there is a problem with distribution or delivery equipment that is necessary for the transportation or delivery of fuel or fuel additives.

The EPA may extend the effectiveness of such waiver for more than 20 days if the problem exists for more than 20 days.

If the EPA does not approve or deny a request for such waiver within three days, the waiver must be considered to be approved.

The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to revise requirements for a fuel system requirements harmonization study by: (1) including the consideration of biofuels in the study, and (2) extending the deadline for reporting on the study until June 1, 2016.</summary>
