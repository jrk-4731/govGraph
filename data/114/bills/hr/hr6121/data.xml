  <summary date="2016-09-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Climate Resiliency, Security, and Source Water Protection Act

This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring each community water system to submit to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) source water and distribution system vulnerability assessments that identify threats from:

 industrial activity, pipelines and storage tanks, contaminated sites, agricultural activity, and oil and gas exploration; climate change, extreme weather, drought, and temperature changes; and intentional acts, including intentional contamination, sabotage, and theft of any chemical of interest. Each community water system must also submit to the EPA protection plans that mitigate the threats to source water and distribution systems.

The EPA must establish a grant program for increasing the resiliency or adaptability of the community water systems to threats.</summary>
