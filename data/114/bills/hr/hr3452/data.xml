The Internal Revenue Code allows an exclusion from gross income for amounts received as a scholarship if such amounts are used to pay for qualified tuition and related expenses. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to include in the definition of "qualified tuition and related expenses" the room and board expenses of a full-time student and expenses payable under a Federal Pell Grant.</summary>
