This bill directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a gold medal to Colonel Charles Young in recognition of his pioneering U.S. Army career during exceptionally challenging times.

Following its award, the medal shall be given to the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio.

It is the sense of Congress that the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center should make the gold medal received available for display or loan so that it may be displayed elsewhere, particularly at other locations associated with Colonel Young's life.</summary>
