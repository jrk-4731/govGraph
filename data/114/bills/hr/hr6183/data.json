This tax shall be collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and deposited into a special account.\n\nThe bill also amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the CBP, upon request of a U.S. exporter, to\u00a0pay to the exporter from this special account an amount equal to the amount of indirect taxes imposed by the importing foreign country, minus any U.S. taxes rebated or funded upon exportation.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative must report on specified matters related to World Trade Organization negotiations, border taxes, and free-trade agreements."
