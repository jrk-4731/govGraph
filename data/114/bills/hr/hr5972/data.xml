  <summary date="2016-09-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Campus Sexual Assault Whistleblower Protection Act of 2016

 This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit the suspension of federal student aid eligibility for a student who: (1) admits, in a sexual assault report, unlawful consumption of a controlled substance or alcohol; and (2) is convicted of a drug offense involving controlled substance possession based on conduct described in such admission.

The bill also modifies eligibility requirements for an institution of higher education (IHE) to participate in federal student aid programs. Specifically, it prohibits an IHE from taking a retaliatory action (e.g., suspension or expulsion) against an enrolled student who reports a sexual assault and admits, in such report: (1) sexual activity, or (2) unlawful consumption of a controlled substance or alcohol. An IHE must annually inform enrolled students that such retaliatory action is prohibited.</summary>
