  <summary date="2016-03-01T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Postal Closures Act of 2016

This bill prohibits the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) from: (1) closing or consolidating any postal facility without the approval of the Postal Regulatory Commission, or (2) closing or consolidating any postal facility or carrying out any network rationalization activity until the Commission has certified that the USPS has met the national service standards that were in effect on July 1, 2012, and that are reinstated by this Act.

For purposes of such prohibitions, "postal facility" means a USPS facility that is primarily involved in the preparation, dispatch, or other physical processing of mail but does not include: (1) any post office, station, or branch; or (2) any facility used only for administrative functions.

 Before making a determination to close or consolidate a postal facility, the USPS must conduct an area mail processing study, which includes: (1) a plan to reduce the capacity of the facility without closing it; and (2) an analysis of the effects of the closure or consolidation on the community, on small businesses, and on specified postal services to individuals.

 If the USPS makes a determination to close or consolidate a postal facility after completing such study, it shall: (1) provide specified notice to Congress, the Commission, the public, and each person in the zip code served by such facility; (2) conduct at least three meetings to receive public comments; and (3) publish a justification of such determination. The Commission shall have 90 days to approve or disapprove the closure or consolidation.

 The Commission shall determine annually if the USPS is meeting the national service standards for market-dominant products. If the Commission finds that the USPS is not meeting such standards, it may recommend corrective actions and reasonable performance targets. The Postmaster General shall respond within 60 days after receiving such recommendations on how the USPS will change operations to achieve them.</summary>
