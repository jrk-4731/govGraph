  <summary date="2015-11-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Retirement Choice Protection Act of 2015

This bill amends Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 to transfer from the Department of Labor to the Department of the&#160;Treasury&#160;regulatory authority for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs),&#160;retirement annuities, Simplified Employee Pensions, and Simple IRAs.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to establish a best interest standard for fiduciaries who provide advice to investors in IRAs and plans not subject to ERISA. The best interest standard allows a financial advisor to make investment recommendations and receive compensation&#160;with respect to certain financial products, including proprietary products, if such advisor makes certain required disclosures.</summary>
