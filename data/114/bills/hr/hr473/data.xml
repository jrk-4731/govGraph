  <summary date="2015-01-22T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Increasing the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability to Veterans Act of 2015

Requires the reduction of the federal annuities of individuals removed from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Senior Executive Service (SES) if they are convicted of a felony that influenced their performance while employed in such position.

Authorizes the VA Secretary to order the reduction of the federal annuities of individuals who were convicted of such a felony and were subject to removal or transfer from the VA SES, but who left the VA before final action was taken.

Reduces such annuities by excluding the covered service performed after the activity that subjects such an individual to transfer or removal occurs.

Requires the performance appraisal system for VA SES employees to provide for five specified annual summary ratings of levels of performance. Provides that in any given year no more than: (1) 10% of such employees may receive the outstanding level of performance, and (2) 20% of such employees may receive the exceeds-fully-successful level of performance.

Requires the Secretary to take any complaint or report from an appropriate person or entity related to any facility or program managed by an SES employee into account in evaluating that employee's performance.

 Directs the Secretary, at least once every five years, to reassign each SES employee to a position at a different location that does not include the supervision of the same personnel or programs. Allows the Secretary to waive such requirement if the Secretary submits to Congress notice of, and the reasons for, such waiver.

Directs the Secretary to contract with a nongovernmental entity for a review of the management training program for VA SES employees.

Prohibits the Secretary from placing a VA SES employee on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status, for more than a total of 14 days during any 365-day period. Allows the Secretary to waive such prohibition with respect to such an employee if the Secretary provides Congress with a detailed explanation of the reasons the employee was placed on such leave or status and the reasons for extending that placement.</summary>
