  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act

This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to modify the definition of "controlled substance analogue" to mean a substance that has a similar (previously, substantially similar) chemical structure and pharmacological effect to a schedule I controlled substance.

 Additionally, it modifies the treatment of controlled substance analogues. Under current law, a controlled substance analogue that is intended for human consumption is treated as a schedule I controlled substance. This bill replaces the "intended for human consumption" qualifier with a "not a chemical substance subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act" qualifier. Specifically, a controlled substance analogue that is not a chemical substance under the Toxic Substances Control Act is treated as a schedule I controlled substance.

 The bill modifies the drug quantity thresholds that trigger a mandatory minimum prison term for a defendant who manufactures, distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute fentanyl.

It also establishes a consecutive mandatory prison term for a defendant who commits a drug offense involving a detectable amount of heroin or fentanyl.

The bill allows the Drug Enforcement Administration to temporarily place a substance into schedule I if it reasonably believes that the substance: (1) is a synthetic opioid analgesic; (2) is the object of clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution; and (3) poses an imminent hazard to public health and safety. Finally, the bill makes it a crime to knowingly mail to an unauthorized person equipment that may be used to manufacture counterfeit controlled substances.</summary>
