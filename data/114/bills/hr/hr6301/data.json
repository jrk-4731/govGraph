In the case of such a required repayment by reason that the contract providing for the payment of the bonus is found invalid, the department shall:\n\n appoint an investigating officer; confirm that such officer determines that the member committed fraud or did not complete the service requirement; and obtain the written concurrence of a general or flag officer in the member's chain of command. The department shall repay, and pay interest on, any amount a member repaid the Department of Defense for a bonus or similar payment the contract for which was found to be invalid."
