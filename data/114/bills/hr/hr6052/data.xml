 This bill amends the federal criminal code to prohibit firearm possession by a person who has been adjudicated of committing a violent juvenile act.

 The term "violent juvenile act" means: (1) an act by a person under the age of 18 that, if committed by an adult, would be punishable by a prison term exceeding one year and that either has, as an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person or involves, by its nature, a substantial risk that physical force against another person may be used; and (2) such an act that is committed by a person who has attained age 18 but not age 21 for which the person is tried as a juvenile or youthful offender under state law.</summary>
