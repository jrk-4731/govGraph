  <summary date="2015-07-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Manufactured Housing Energy Efficiency Act

This bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to revise requirements governing when the Department of Energy (DOE) must update energy conservation standards for residential manufactured housing, commonly known as mobile homes. Currently, DOE's energy conservation standards for such housing are based on the most recent version of the model International Energy Conservation Code and DOE must update the standards within a year of a revision to the code, unless the code is not cost-effective, or a more stringent standard would be more cost-effective.

The bill requires DOE to make a determination on whether updating its energy conservation standards based on the revised code would improve energy efficiency in manufactured housing before updating those standards.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development must: (1) administer and enforce the energy conservation standards established by this bill, and (2) make public each year aggregate information on enforcement actions with respect to those standards.</summary>
