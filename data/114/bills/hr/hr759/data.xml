TITLE I--RECIDIVISM RISK REDUCTION

Recidivism Risk Reduction Act

(Sec. 102) This bill directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to: (1) develop a prisoner risk and needs assessment system; (2) develop recommendations regarding recidivism reduction programs and productive activities; and (3) conduct ongoing research regarding data analysis&#160;on best practices, needs assessment tools, and recidivism reduction programs.

 (Sec. 103) The bill establishes requirements&#160;regarding the assessment system and DOJ's recommendations.

 (Sec. 106) The bill amends the federal criminal code to establish procedures for implementation&#160;of&#160;the assessment system and DOJ's recommendations by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP).

Officers and employees may use pepper spray to reduce violent acts by prisoners and visitors.

(Sec. 303) The Government Accountability Office shall: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of issuance of pepper spray issued pursuant to this bill and the advisability of its use in minimum- or low-security prisons, and (2) make recommendations to improve the safety of BOP officers and employees.

TITLE IV--BUREAU OF PRISONS SECURE FIREARMS STORAGE

Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act of 2016

 (Sec. 403)&#160;The BOP must&#160;ensure that each chief executive officer of a federal penal or correctional institution: (1) allows qualified law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms beyond the institution's secure perimeter, and (2) either provides&#160;such officers with&#160;a secure firearm-storage area beyond the perimeter or allows&#160;them to store firearms in a BOP-approved&#160;vehicle lockbox.

TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS

(Sec. 501) The BOP&#160;must incorporate specialized and comprehensive de-escalation training into its training programs.

 (Sec. 503) The bill generally prohibits the monitoring of electronic communications between a prisoner in a BOP facility and the prisoner's attorney.

(Sec. 504) The BOP shall establish pilot programs related to: (1) pairing incarcerated youth with volunteer mentors; and (2) equipping prisoners with skills to provide training and therapy to abandoned, rescued, or otherwise vulnerable animals.

 (Sec. 505) The bill requires supervision by probation officers and pretrial services officers, when directed by the court, of conditionally released persons determined to be sexually dangerous.

(Sec. 506) The bill expands data collection requirements regarding the National Prisoner Statistics Program.

(Sec. 507) The bill reauthorizes through FY2020, and revises, the Federal Prisoner Reentry Initiative.

A defendant may make a motion for modification of an imposed term of imprisonment if the BOP does not make such a motion within 30 days of a defendant's request.

(Sec. 508) The BOP must designate a release preparation coordinator at each BOP facility that houses prisoners.

Each prisoner shall, with individualized assistance, develop a comprehensive release plan.</summary>
