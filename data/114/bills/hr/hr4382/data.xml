This bill amends the Federal Food Donation Act of 2008 to require contractors who enter into contracts above $25,000 with a federal executive agency for the provision, service, or sale of food in the United States to submit annual reports on the weight of food that was disposed of by donation, composting, or discarding. The agency must submit such reports to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the OMB must then submit an annual report to Congress aggregating the information in the reports.</summary>
