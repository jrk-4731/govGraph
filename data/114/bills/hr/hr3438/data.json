The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nRequire Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act of 2016 or the REVIEW Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill prohibits a final agency rule from being published or taking effect until the agency submits the rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and the OIRA makes a determination as to whether the rule is a high-impact rule. The agency shall publish such determination with the final rule.\n\nAn agency shall postpone the effective date of a high-impact rule until the final disposition of all actions seeking judicial review of the rule.\n\nIf no person seeks judicial review of a high-impact rule during any period explicitly provided for such review under the authorizing statute or during the 60-day period after the rule is published if no such period is explicitly provided, the rule may take effect as early as the date the applicable period ends.\n\nThe bill defines a \"high-impact rule\" as any rule that the OIRA determines may impose an annual cost on the economy of at least $1 billion."
