Require Evaluation before Implementing Executive Wishlists Act of 2016 or the REVIEW Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill prohibits a final agency rule from being published or taking effect until the agency submits the rule to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and the OIRA makes a determination as to whether the rule is a high-impact rule. The agency shall publish such determination with the final rule.

An agency shall postpone the effective date of a high-impact rule until the final disposition of all actions seeking judicial review of the rule.

If no person seeks judicial review of a high-impact rule during any period explicitly provided for such review under the authorizing statute or during the 60-day period after the rule is published if no such period is explicitly provided, the rule may take effect as early as the date the applicable period ends.

The bill defines a "high-impact rule" as any rule that the OIRA determines may impose an annual cost on the economy of at least $1 billion.</summary>
