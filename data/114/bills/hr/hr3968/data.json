    "text": "Stop Meth Labs and Enhance Patient Access Act of 2015 \n\nThis bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to revise the standard used by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to determine whether to exempt a scheduled listed chemical product from certain applicable requirements. (A scheduled listed chemical product is a nonprescription drug product that contains ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine.)\n\nCurrently, the DEA may exempt retail sales of a scheduled listed chemical product from certain requirements (e.g., daily sales limits) if the product cannot be used to illegally manufacture methamphetamine. This bill allows the DEA to exempt retail sales of a scheduled listed chemical product from such requirements if it is not practical by processes known to be employed by clandestine laboratory operators to use the product to illegally manufacture methamphetamine."
