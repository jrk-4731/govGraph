This bill amends the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to make the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Choice Program permanent. (The program allows the furnishing of hospital care and medical services to eligible veterans through agreements with non-VA entities.)

Program eligibility requirements are revised.

 The VA shall ensure that veterans enrolled in the health care system, particularly those with service-connected disabilities rated 50% or greater, are able to receive:

 health care at VA medical facilities within certain wait-time goals; and the highest degree of care possible, with an emphasis on maintaining the highest degree of quality in treating ailments unique to or prevalent among the veteran population, including mental health services.</summary>
