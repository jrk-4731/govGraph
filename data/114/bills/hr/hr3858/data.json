    "text": "September 11th VCF Reauthorization and U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Compensation Act\n\nThis bill amends the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 to exclude future medical expense loss from the economic losses that may be claimed under the fund.\n\nEligibility for compensation under the fund is expanded to include individuals (or relatives of deceased individuals) who were injured or killed in the rescue and recovery efforts after the aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe filing period for claims is extended until October 4, 2021. The 9/11 Fund is established to pay claimants filing after October 3, 2016. A specified amount paid to the U.S. government as part of a plea agreement between the Department of Justice and BNP Paribas must be deposited into the 9/11 Fund.\n\nJustice for United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act\n\nThe United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund is established to compensate victims of state-sponsored terrorism and the Iran hostage crisis. Deposited into the fund are: (1) criminal and civil penalties for violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or the Trading with the Enemy Act, or for a federal offense arising from doing business with or acting on behalf of a state sponsor of terrorism; (2) the amount remaining from the plea agreement between the Department of Justice and BNP Paribas after the deposit to the 9/11 Fund; and (3) proceeds from the sale of certain assets of Iran.\n\nThe bill provides for compensation to a person who informs the Department of Justice of funds or property of a state sponsor of terrorism."
