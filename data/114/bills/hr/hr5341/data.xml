(Sec. 1) This bill: (1) provides that calculation of the basic annuity benefits for an air traffic controller with at least five years of service actively engaged in the separation and control of air traffic shall include service as a first or second level supervisor of such a controller, (2) makes such change effective retroactive to December 12, 2003, and (3) provides for a lump sum payment to each affected annuitant equal to the additional total benefit amount such annuitant would have received had such change been in effect on such date.

The Office of Personnel Management shall establish such procedures as necessary to provide for:

 notification to each annuitant affected by this bill; recalculation of the benefits of affected annuitants; an adjustment to applicable monthly benefit amounts pursuant to such recalculation, to begin as soon as practicable; and such lump sum payment.</summary>
