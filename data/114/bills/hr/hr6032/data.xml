This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business tax credit for the purchase of qualified data breach insurance. The credit applies for five years and is equal to 15% of the annual premiums paid or incurred for the insurance in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.

Qualified data breach insurance is coverage provided by an insurance company for expenses or losses in connection with the theft, loss, disclosure, inaccessibility, or manipulation of data.

Insurance does not qualify for the credit unless the taxpayer has adopted and is in compliance with: (1) the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or (2) any similar standard specified by the Internal Revenue Service.</summary>
