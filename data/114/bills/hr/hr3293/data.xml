 (Sec. 2) This bill directs the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award federal funding for basic research and education in the sciences through a new research grant or cooperative agreement only if it makes an affirmative determination, justified in writing, that the grant or agreement promotes the progress of science in the United States, is worthy of federal funding, and meets certain other criteria.

The bill declares that such a determination shall be made after a research grant or cooperative agreement proposal has first satisfied the NSF's reviews for Merit and Broader Impacts.</summary>
