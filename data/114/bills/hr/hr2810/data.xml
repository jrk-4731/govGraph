This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: (1) review the extent to which federal agencies have reduced travel expenses by using video conferencing, and (2) develop a plan to reduce federal agency travel expenses by 50% below FY2015 levels or the greatest reduction OMB considers feasible by FY2019. Beginning in FY2019, OMB must implement the plan by rescinding from agency budgets the amounts proposed for reduction by the plan.</summary>
