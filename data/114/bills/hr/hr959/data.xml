Medgar Evers House Study Act

 (Sec. 3) Directs the Department of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the home of the late civil rights activist Medgar Evers, which is located at 2332 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive in Jackson, Mississippi.

Requires Interior to: (1) evaluate the national significance of the site; (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System (NPS); (3) determine the effect of the site's designation on existing commercial and recreational uses, and the effect on state and local governments to manage those activities; and (4) identify any authorities, including condemnation, that will compel or permit the Department of the Interior to influence or participate in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or place restrictions on nonfederal land if the site is designated as an NPS unit.</summary>
