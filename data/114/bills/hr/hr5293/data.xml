This bill provides FY2017 appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military activities, including appropriations for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)/ Global War on Terrorism.

The bill does not include funding for military construction, military family housing, civil works projects of the Army Corps of Engineers, and nuclear warheads, which are all considered in other appropriations bills.

The bill increases total funding for DOD compared to FY2016 levels and provides additional OCO funding for many accounts. OCO funding is not subject to discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement procedures.

The bill also contains provisions that prohibit or restrict funds from being used to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility; transfer the detainees to other countries; or construct or modify facilities for the purpose of housing the detainees.
