This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income for seven years amounts received from the sale of certain drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

The exclusion applies to the sale of a drug approved or licensed as a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease and that has been designated as a breakthrough therapy under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The drug must be sold through an arm's length transaction by a holder of the approved application for the drug.</summary>
