Requires such Commission to evaluate federal agencies and their programs each year for a six-year period&nbsp;to determine whether: (1) two or more agencies or programs are performing the same essential function and such function can be consolidated or streamlined; (2) any agency or program has wasted federal funds by egregious spending, mismanagement of resources and personnel, or&nbsp;use of funds for personal benefit or the benefit of a special interest group; and (3)&nbsp;any agency or program has completed its intended purpose, has become irrelevant, or has failed to meet its objectives. Requires the realignment or elimination of such agencies or programs.</p> <p>Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Commission. Sets forth procedures for consideration and implementation by Congress of Commission recommendations.</p>]]></text>
