  <summary date="2015-03-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No Hungry Kids Act

Nullifies the rule published by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) on January 26, 2012, establishing nutrition standards for the school lunch and breakfast programs. (This rule is summarized as requiring most schools to increase the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free and low-fat fluid milk in school meals; reduce the levels of sodium, saturated fat and trans fat in meals; and meet the nutrition needs of school children within their calorie requirements.)

Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to prohibit USDA's minimum nutritional requirements for school lunches from being construed as establishing a calorie maximum for individual school lunches or prohibiting a child from eating a lunch provided by the child's parent or legal guardian.</summary>
