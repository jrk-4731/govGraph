 This bill requires each servicer of a home mortgage to provide in writing to a mortgagor of a residential mortgage loan specified prompt notifications and decisions regarding the mortgagor's written request for a short sale of the dwelling or residential real property subject to the mortgage, deed of trust, or other security interest securing the mortgage loan.

An aggrieved individual may bring a civil action for equitable relief and a monetary award of $1,000 for any violation of this Act.

This bill shall not apply to certain residential mortgages entered into before its enactment whose mortgage agreements explicitly provide a procedure or terms for a short sale approval.</summary>
