This bill prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from proposing, implementing, or enforcing restrictions under the Clean Air Act on methane emissions from: (1) crude oil production; or (2) natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage.

The EPA may not finalize or enforce the proposed rule entitled, "Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New and Modified Sources," which proposes to amend the new source performance standards for oil and gas production by setting standards for methane and volatile organic compounds.</summary>
