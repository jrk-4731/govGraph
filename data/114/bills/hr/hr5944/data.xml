  <summary date="2016-10-08T03:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)

(Sec. 1) This bill declares that an airport owner or operator who renews a covered lease shall not be treated as violating that owner's or operator's written airport improvement project grant assurance requirement to maintain a schedule of airport passenger user charges that will make the airport as self-sustaining as possible under existing circumstances.

The bill defines "covered lease" to mean a lease:

 already existing before enactment of this bill, in which a nominal lease rate is provided, under which the lessee is a federal or state government entity, and that supports the operation of Air Force or Air National Guard aircraft at the airport or remotely from the airport.</summary>
