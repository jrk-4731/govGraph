  <summary date="2016-06-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Pathway for SGR Reform Act of 2013 to specify that&#160;certain provisions of&#160;current law&#160;regarding&#160;the calculation of hospital length of stay apply to certain long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) that are permitted, under Medicare, to establish new LTCHs or increase LTCH beds. Specifically, with respect to such LTCHs, two types of patients shall be&#160;excluded from the&#160;calculation of&#160;LTCH length of stay under Medicare: (1) those for whom payment is made under a Medicare Advantage plan, and (2) those for whom payment is made at the site-neutral payment rate.</summary>
