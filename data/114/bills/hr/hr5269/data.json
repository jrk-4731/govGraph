A progenitor is an individual who provides an egg or a sperm cell from which an embryo is created.\n\nA violator is subject to a fine, up to six months in prison, or both.\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to the destruction of an embryo during or after an attempt to implant it.\n\nAdditionally, the bill bars the criminal prosecution of a progenitor of an embryo that is destroyed."
