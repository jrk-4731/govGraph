This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime to knowingly destroy a living human embryo created through in vitro fertilization without the written consent of each progenitor. A progenitor is an individual who provides an egg or a sperm cell from which an embryo is created.

A violator is subject to a fine, up to six months in prison, or both.

The prohibition does not apply to the destruction of an embryo during or after an attempt to implant it.

Additionally, the bill bars the criminal prosecution of a progenitor of an embryo that is destroyed.</summary>
