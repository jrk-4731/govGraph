  <summary date="2016-07-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to deny the transfer of a firearm or explosive, or the issuance of an explosives license or permit, to known or suspected terrorists. Specifically, the bill authorizes DOJ to deny those transfers, licenses, or permits if the citizens or permanent residents of the United States are included in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Terrorist Screening Database's no-fly list or the selectee list.

DOJ and federal, state, and local law enforcement must be notified immediately of requests to transfer a firearm or explosive to a person who is, or in the last five years was, identified on the database.

The bill establishes a judicial review process for appealing a denial by DOJ.</summary>
