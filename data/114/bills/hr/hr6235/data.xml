  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to transfer certain property within the exterior boundaries of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation within North Dakota that was acquired by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project to the Department of the Interior to be held in trust for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota.

The Corps of Engineers shall convey to North Dakota all right of the United States to certain property in Burleigh County, Emmons County, or Morton County in North Dakota that was acquired by the United States for such project and and that is located above the top of the exclusive flood pool of the project.

The transfer of such land shall not interfere with any of the authorized purposes of such project, any project of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program, or any applicable law. The Corps of Engineers shall retain: (1) the right to inundate with water or cause erosion to the transferred lands as necessary for the operation of such projects; and (2) any land, structures, easements or other property interests necessary to carry out such projects.

 The Tribe and North Dakota shall be responsible for the payment of costs and administrative expenses associated with the transfers and for any coordination necessary with respect to requirements related to endangered species, cultural resources, and clean air.</summary>
