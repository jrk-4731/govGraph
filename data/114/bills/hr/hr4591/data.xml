This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in addition to furnishing hospital care, medical services, or extended care at VA facilities or under contracts or sharing agreements, to furnish such care and services to eligible veterans through the use of Veterans Care Agreements with eligible providers.

An eligible provider is:

 a provider whose income in the year preceding the year of entering into an agreement did not exceed $11 million; a provider who does not otherwise provide such care or services pursuant to a federal contract; and a physician or provider of Medicaid or Medicare services, an Aging and Disability Resource Center, an area agency on aging, or a center for independent living. The VA shall: (1) establish a certifying process for providers, (2) review agreements at least once every two years, and (3) use the quality of care standards set forth or used by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.

The VA may enter into an agreement using non-competitive procedures.</summary>
