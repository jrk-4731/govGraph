This bill amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the administering authority (i.e., the Secretary of Commerce, or any other officer of the United States to whom the responsibility for carrying out duties under such Act regarding countervailing and antidumping duties are transferred by law) to determine an individual countervailable subsidy rate for an exporter or producer, upon the request of such exporter or producer, if four or fewer exporters and producers are involved in the investigation or review.

The bill shall apply to any investigation or review initiated by such authority on or after March 1, 2015.</summary>
