  <summary date="2016-02-01T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Wind Energy Research and Development Act of 2016

This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to carry out a research and development program to: (1) improve the energy efficiency, reliability, and capacity of wind energy generation; (2) optimize the design and adaptability of wind energy systems to the broadest practical range of atmospheric conditions; and (3) reduce the cost of permitting, construction, operation, and maintenance of wind energy systems.

DOE must also conduct a wind energy technology validation and market transformation program for demonstrating and validating new wind energy technologies with the potential to be cost-competitive for land-based, offshore, and distributed applications.

DOE must conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities to reduce barriers to the widespread adoption of wind power. The program must support developing new wildlife impact mitigation technologies to reduce the potential impacts of wind energy facilities on wildlife species.

DOE must maintain a wind energy incubator program to support innovative technologies that are not represented in a significant way in DOE's current portfolio of wind energy research activities or in current technology roadmaps.</summary>
