    "text": "Secure, Accessible, Valuable, Efficient Universal Pension Accounts Act or the SAVE UP Act \n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the SAVE UP Account program to provide tax-exempt retirement accounts to employees who are not otherwise eligible for certain retirement plans.\n\nThe bill establishes: (1) a board of trustees to create and manage the accounts, (2) a board of governors to establish policies for the investment and management of fund assets, and (3) a trust fund and accounts in the Treasury for the program.\n\nAn employer must establish an account contribution program if: (1) the employer's aggregate number of employee hours of service during the preceding year was at least 1,600; (2) the employer does not offer a retirement plan to all employees. Government entities and churches are exempt from this requirement.\n\nUnder the contribution program, employers must: (1) contribute at least 50 cents per hour worked by the employee; and (2) make automatic contributions on behalf of employees who do not opt-out, beginning with 3% of wages and eventually increasing to 5%.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements for: (1) determining an employee's share of positive net investment returns, and (2) paying benefits from the accounts in the form of an annuity\n\nThe bill allows a tax credit for certain small employers who elect to set up contribution programs for their employees.\n\nIf an employer fails to maintain a required contribution program, the bill disallows the deduction for compensation for services performed by employees of the employer."
