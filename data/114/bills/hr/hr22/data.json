Typically, a road show is a series of meetings across different cities, often before an IPO, in which top executives from a company have the opportunity to talk with current or potential investors.)\n\n(Sec. 71002) Prescribes a grace period during which an issuer that was an EGC at the time it filed a confidential registration statement (or, in lieu of that, a publicly filed registration statement) for SEC review, but ceases to be an EGC, shall continue to be treated as an emerging market growth company for one year or, if earlier, until consummation of its IPO.\n\n(Sec. 71003) Amends the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to direct the SEC to prescribe conditions under which a registration statement filed (or submitted for confidential review) by an issuer before its IPO may omit financial disclosure information for historical periods otherwise required.\n\nTITLE LXXII--DISCLOSURE MODERNIZATION AND SIMPLIFICATION (Sec. 72001) Directs the SEC to issue regulations permitting issuers to submit a summary page on annual and transition report form 10-K if each item on that page cross-references electronically or otherwise the material contained in form 10-K to which the item relates.\n\n (Sec. 72002) Directs the SEC to revise regulation S-K (Standard Instructions for Filing Forms under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975) in order to:\n\n reduce the burden on smaller issuers, including emerging growth companies, accelerated filers, and smaller reporting companies (while still providing all material information to investors); and eliminate duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or unnecessary provisions. (Sec. 72003) Requires the SEC to study ways to: (1) modernize and simplify requirements in regulation S-K, and (2) evaluate information delivery and presentation methods as well as explore methods to discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information.\n\nDirects the SEC also to issue a proposed rule to implement any recommendations it makes to Congress based upon the study.\n\nTITLE LXXIII--BULLION AND COLLECTIBLE COIN PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY AND COST SAVINGS (Sec. 73001) Repeals: (1) the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to change the design of certain gold bullion coins, and (2) requirements for the protective covering for certain bullion coins.\n\n Repeals the copper content requirements for quarter dollar coins, and requires the silver content to be at least 90%.\n\nMakes technical revisions to the requirements for palladium bullion investment coins.\n\n (Sec. 73002) Requires proof and uncirculated versions of American Eagle silver coins issued during calendar year 2016 to have a smooth edge incused with a designation that notes the 30th anniversary of the first issue of such coins.\n\nTITLE LXXIV--SBIC ADVISERS RELIEF (Sec. 74001) Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to exempt specified advisers of small business investment companies (SBICs) from certain: (1) SEC registration requirements with respect to the provision of investment advice relating to venture capital funds, and (2) SEC registration and reporting requirements with respect to assets under management of private funds.\n\n (Sec. 74003) Extends the same exemption to specified SBIC advisers with respect to any state or local law requiring the registration, licensing, or qualifications of investment advisers.\n\nTITLE LXXV--ELIMINATE PRIVACY NOTICE CONFUSION\n\n(Sec. 75001) Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to exempt from its annual privacy policy notice requirement any financial institution which: (1) provides nonpublic personal information only in accordance with specified requirements, and (2) has not changed its policies and practices with regard to disclosing nonpublic personal information from those disclosed in the most recent disclosure sent to consumers.\n\nTITLE LXXVI--REFORMING ACCESS FOR INVESTMENTS IN STARTUP ENTERPRISES\n\n(Sec.76001) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt from security registration requirements, and related prohibitions against using interstate commerce and the mails for the sale or delivery of securities after sale, any transaction where:\n\n each purchaser is an accredited investor; neither the seller, nor any person acting on the seller's behalf, offers or sells securities by general solicitation or advertising; the seller and prospective purchaser obtain from an issuer meeting certain criteria reasonably current specified information; the transaction is not for the sale of a security whose seller is neither an issuer nor a subsidiary of the issuer; neither the seller, nor any person receiving remuneration for participating in the offer or sale of the securities, is subject to certain legal disqualification (bad actor); the issuer is engaged in business, is not in the organizational stage or in bankruptcy or receivership, and is not a blank check, blind pool, or shell company with no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that the issuer's primary business plan is to engage in a merger or combination of the business with, or an acquisition of, an unidentified person; the transaction does not involve a security that constitutes the whole or part of an unsold allotment to, or a subscription or participation by, a broker or dealer as an underwriter of the security or a redistribution; and the transaction does involve a security of a class authorized and outstanding for at least 90 days before the transaction. Deems any securities acquired in such exempt transactions to: (1) have been acquired in a transaction not involving any public offering, (2) not be a distribution involving an underwriter, and (2) be restricted securities not subject to certain transaction requirements.\n\nExempts all transactions under this Act from state regulation of securities offerings.\n\nTITLE LXXVII--PRESERVATION ENHANCEMENT AND SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY (Sec. 77001) Amends the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA) with respect to a plan of action the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may approve for extension of the low-income affordability restrictions on any eligible low-income housing.\n\n Entitles the owner of a property subject to a plan of action or use agreement to distribute:\n\n annually all surplus cash generated by the property, but only if the owner is in material compliance with the use agreement, including compliance with prevailing physical condition standards established by HUD; and any funds accumulated in a residual receipts account, notwithstanding any conflicting provision in the use agreement, but only if the individual is in material compliance with the use agreement and has completed, or set aside sufficient funds to complete, any capital repairs identified by the most recent third party capital needs assessment. Requires an owner distributing any such amounts to:\n\n continue to operate the property in accordance with the affordability requirements of its use agreement for its remaining useful life; continue to renew or extend any project-based rental assistance contract for at least 20 years, as required by the property's plan of action; and have the option to extend the contract to a 20-year term, if he or she has an existing multi-year project-based rental assistance contract for less than 20 years. (Sec. 77002) Prohibits the LIHPRHA, or any plan of action or use agreement implementing it, from restricting an owner from obtaining a new loan or refinancing an existing loan secured by a low-income housing project, or from distributing the proceeds of such a loan, except that, in conjunction with such refinancing:\n\n the owner shall provide for adequate rehabilitation pursuant to a capital needs assessment to ensure long-term sustainability of the property satisfactory to the lender or bond issuance agency; any resulting budget-based rent increase shall include debt service on the new financing, commercially reasonable debt service coverage, and replacement reserves as required by the lender; and any rent increases resulting from the refinancing transaction for units not covered by a project-based rental subsidy contract shall be limited to 10%, with the following exception. Prohibits requiring any tenant who occupies a dwelling unit as of the time of the refinancing, and gives the owner proof of income, to pay for rent and utilities, for the duration of the tenancy, any amount exceeding the greater of: (1) 30% of the tenant's income, or (2) the amount the tenant paid for rent and utilities immediately before the refinancing.\n\n (Sec. 77003) Directs HUD to issue any guidance necessary to carry out this Act within 120 days after its enactment.\n\nTITLE LXXVIII--TENANT INCOME VERIFICATION RELIEF (Sec. 78001) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to annual review of low-income families' income for eligibility requirements for certain federal assisted housing programs.\n\n Declares that, after the initial review of any family's fix income, a public housing agency (PHA) or owner may not be required to review its income for any year for which the family certifies, in accordance with specified requirements as HUD shall establish.\n\n Requires the PHA or the owner to review each such family's income at least once every three years.\n\n Requires PHAs also to review the income of a family receiving Section 8 (rental assistance voucher program) assistance at least once every three years (currently, at least annually).\n\nTITLE LXXIX--HOUSING ASSISTANCE EFFICIENCY (Sec. 79001) Amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to allow (in addition to a state, local government, or public housing agency) a private nonprofit organization to administer permanent housing rental assistance provided through the Continuum of Care Program under the Act.\n\n (Sec. 79002) Requires HUD, at least once (currently, twice) during each fiscal year, to reallocate any housing assistance provided from the Emergency Solutions Grants Program that is unused or returned or that becomes available after the minimum allocation requirements under the Act.\n\nTITLE LXXX--CHILD SUPPORT ASSISTANCE (Sec. 80001) Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with respect to the permissible purposes of consumer reports, to authorize a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report in response to a request by the head of a state or local child support enforcement agency (or an authorized state or local government official), if the requester certifies that the report is needed for enforcing a child support order, award, agreement, or judgment.\n\n Repeals the requirement for 10 days' prior notice to a consumer whose report is requested.\n\nTITLE LXXXI--PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING (Sec. 81001) Directs HUD to establish a demonstration program under which, in FY2016 through FY2019, it may execute budget-neutral, performance-based agreements (for up to 12 years each) that result in a reduction in energy or water costs with appropriate entities to carry out projects for energy or water conservation improvements at up to 20,000 residential units in multifamily buildings participating in:\n\n Section 8 project-based rental assistance programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937, other than Section 8 (voucher program) assistance; supportive housing for the elderly programs under the Housing Act of 1959; or supportive housing for persons with disabilities programs under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. Prescribes requirements for payment under an agreement, which shall be contingent on documented utility savings, as well as for agreement terms, eligibility, geographical diversity, and funding for the program.\n\n Limits this demonstration program to properties subject to affordability restrictions, which may be through an affordability agreement under a new housing assistance payments contract with HUD, or through an enforceable covenant with the property owner, for at least 15 years after completion of any conservation improvements made under the program.\n\nRequires HUD to submit to specified congressional committees a detailed plan for the implementation of this Act.\n\n Authorizes HUD, for each fiscal year during which an agreement is in effect, to use any appropriated funds for the renewal of contracts under the program.\n\nTITLE LXXXII--CAPITAL ACCESS FOR SMALL COMMUNITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (Sec. 82001) Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.\n\n Declares that a credit union which lacks federal deposit insurance and has applied for membership in a federal home loan bank may be treated as meeting all the eligibility requirements for federal deposit insurance if the supervisor of the chartering state has determined that it meets all federal deposit insurance eligibility requirements.\n\nDeems such a credit union to have met the eligibility criteria for federal home loan bank membership if, six months after its application date, the state supervisor has failed to act upon the application.\n\nDeclares that no state law authorizing a conservator or liquidating agent of a credit union to repudiate contracts may apply to any: (1) extension of credit from a federal home loan bank to a credit union which is a member of that bank, or (2) security interest in the assets of the credit union securing such extension of credit.\n\n Declares that if a federal home loan bank makes an advance to a state-chartered credit union that is not federally insured:\n\n the bank's interest in any collateral securing that advance has the same priority and is afforded the same standing and rights that the security interest would have had if the advance had been made to a federally-insured credit union, and the bank has the same right to access such collateral that it would have had if the advance had been made to a federally-insured credit union. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require private deposit insurers of credit unions that are members of a federal home loan bank to submit copies of their audit reports within seven days to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\n (Sec. 82002) Directs the Government Accountability Office to study: (1) the adequacy of insurance reserves held by a private deposit insurer that insures deposits in an insured credit union or any credit union eligible to apply to become one, and (2) such credit unions' compliance with federal regulations governing disclosure of a lack of federal deposit insurance.\n\nTITLE LXXXIII--SMALL BANK EXAM CYCLE REFORM (Sec. 83001) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase from $500 million to $1 billion the asset size of small insured depository institutions eligible for 18-month on-site examination cycles.\n\n Qualifies such an institution also for the 18-month cycle if its total assets are at most $200 million (currently $100 million) and the most recent examination found its composite condition to be good rather than outstanding.\n\nGrants a federal banking agency discretion to increase this assets ceiling amount from $200 million to $1 billion (currently from $100 million to $500 million) if that greater asset size would be consistent with the principles of safety and soundness.\n\nTITLE LXXXIV--SMALL COMPANY SIMPLE REGISTRATION\n\n(Sec. 84001) Directs the SEC to revise Form S-1 so that a smaller reporting company may incorporate by reference in a registration statement filed on that form any documents it files with the SEC after the registration statement's effective date.\n\nTITLE LXXXV--HOLDING COMPANY REGISTRATION THRESHOLD EQUALIZATION\n\n(Sec. 85001) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require an issuer that is a savings and loan holding company to register with the SEC if: (1) its assets exceed $10 million, and (2) it has a class of equity security held of record by 2,000 or more persons.\n\nRequires this registration to be terminated after a savings and loan holding company certifies that its holders of record of that class of security have been reduced to fewer than 1,200 persons.\n\nDeclares that the duty of a savings and loan holding company to file supplementary and periodic information shall be suspended automatically if the securities of each class to which the registration statement relates (other than any class of asset-backed securities) are held of record by fewer than 1,200 persons.\n\nTITLE LXXXVI--REPEAL OF INDEMNIFICATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n(Sec. 86001) Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to repeal the requirement that specified entities agree to indemnify the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for any expenses arising from litigation relating to certain information about swaps cleared by derivatives clearing organizations which is shared with the entities before the CFTC may share the information with them.\n\nRepeals a similar requirement for the same entities with which a swap data repository may share swap data to agree to indemnify the repository and the CFTC for any expenses arising from similar litigation.\n\nAmends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to repeal a similar requirement for the same entities (plus the CFTC) with which a securities-based swap data repository may share securities-based swap data to agree to indemnify the repository and the SEC for any expenses arising from similar litigation.\n\nMakes these repeals take effect retroactively to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n\nTITLE LXXXVII--TREATMENT OF DEBT OR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF SMALLER INSTITUTIONS\n\n(Sec. 87001) Amends the Financial Stability Act of 2010 with respect to the date for determining the consolidated assets of smaller depository institution holding companies supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nExempts from otherwise required capital deductions, pursuant to mandatory minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, any debt or equity instruments issued before May 19, 2010, by depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of March 31, 2010 (currently as of December 31, 2009).\n\nTITLE LXXXVIII--STATE LICENSING EFFICIENCY\n\nState Licensing Efficiency Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 88002) Amends the S.A.F.E.

(Currently the creditor must operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.)\n\nAuthorizes the CFPB also to exempt a creditor, in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, from the requirement to establish an escrow or impound account for the consumer if the creditor operates in rural or underserved areas, whether predominantly or not. (Currently the creditor must operate predominantly in such areas.)"
