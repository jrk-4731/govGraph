This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration to refer new drug applications for opioids without abuse deterrent properties to an advisory committee.

This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the Department of Justice (DOJ) to support opioid abuse services and programs for veterans.

Opioid Program Evaluation Act or the OPEN Act

DOJ and HHS must have a nonfederal entity evaluate the grants established by this bill.

Promoting Responsible Opioid Management and Incorporating Scientific Expertise Act or the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) must update the VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain.

The VA must carry out activities related to opioid abuse, including expanding the opioid safety initiative to include all VA medical facilities.

Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect Act

The national clearinghouse for child abuse information must provide information on plans of safe care for infants born affected by substance abuse.

This bill amends the Social Security Act, including to permit prescription drug plan sponsors to establish programs for beneficiaries at-risk for prescription drug abuse.</summary>
