(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 with respect to submission of site and design proposals by the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. (sponsor) for the National Liberty Memorial to honor the slaves and free black persons who served as soldiers and sailors or provided civilian assistance during the American Revolution.

The site and design approval process is revised to make the Department of Agriculture, rather than the Department of the Interior or the General Services Administration, responsible for consideration of these site and design proposals and their submission, on behalf of the sponsor, to the Commission of Fine Arts and National Capital Planning Commission.</summary>
