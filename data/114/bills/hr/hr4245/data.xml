  <summary date="2016-12-10T22:25:37Z" status="Passed Senate amended">(Sec. 1) This bill requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to issue a proposed rule that establishes expedited procedures relating to the export permission requirements of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for sea urchins and sea cucumbers that are designated as food for humans or animals. The USFWS may include in the rule an exemption from export permission requirements or export licensing requirements for those species.

If an exemption will have a significant negative impact on the conservation of sea urchins or sea cucumbers, the USFWS may not provide the exemption to the requirements. In addition, the USFWS may not provide an exemption to an entity that has been convicted of a violation of a law relating to the importation, transportation, or exportation of wildlife in the five years preceding the date on which the entity applied for the exemption.</summary>
