The USFWS may include in the rule an exemption from export permission requirements or export licensing requirements for those species.\n\nIf an exemption will have a significant negative impact on the conservation of sea urchins or sea cucumbers, the USFWS may not provide the exemption to the requirements. In addition, the USFWS may not provide an exemption to an entity that has been convicted of a violation of a law relating to the importation, transportation, or exportation of wildlife in the five years preceding the date on which the entity applied for the exemption."
