However, current law exempts from this limitation: (1)\u00a0physicians' services furnished by the individual's attending physician, if not an employee of the hospice program; and (2) services provided or arranged by the hospice program.\n\nThe bill expands this exemption with regard to rural health clinic and FQHC services. Specifically, the Medicare payment limitation shall not apply to such services that: (1) would otherwise be physicians' services if furnished by an individual\u00a0unaffiliated with a rural health clinic or FQHC; and (2) are either\u00a0arranged by the hospice program or furnished by the individual's attending physician, if not an employee of the hospice program."
