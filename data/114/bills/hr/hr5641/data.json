Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to require state and local educational agencies to conduct an annual equity gap assessment for career and technical education programs of study and create plans on how to reduce the gap.The \"equity gap\" consists of the gaps in participation and performance between students based on gender, race, and certain special populations.\n\nThe bill requires states to provide professional development and technical assistance to help local educational agencies close equity gaps in career and technical education.States and local agencies that fail to make improvements in closing equity gaps must implement an improvement plan.The Department of Education (ED)may withhold funding from states that fail to show improvement in closing equity gaps.Additionally, states may withhold funding from local agencies that fail to make improvements.\n\nStates must also annually report toED on the progress of the state in closing equity gaps."
