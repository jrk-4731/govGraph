  <summary date="2015-07-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Sandra Day O'Connor Civic Learning Act of 2015

This bill amends part C (Innovation for Teacher Quality) of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to repeal the We the People civic education program and replace it with a competitive grant program to promote civic learning and engagement, American history, geography, and economics.

The bill authorizes the Department of Education to award grants to nonprofit educational organizations to develop and implement such programs through instruction, professional development, and evaluation activities that promote equity, innovation, scalability, and accountability.</summary>
