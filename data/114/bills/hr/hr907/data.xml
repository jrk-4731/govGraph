United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) This bill specifies the findings of Congress that:

 as of January 22, 2015, the United States has provided over $3 billion in assistance to respond to the Syria humanitarian crisis, of which nearly $467 million has been provided to Jordan; as of January 2015, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there were 621,937 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, 83.8% of whom lived outside refugee camps; in 2000 the United States and Jordan signed a free-trade agreement that went into force in 2001; in 1996 the United States granted Jordan major non-NATO ally status; and Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). (Sec. 3) U.S. policy should be to:

 support Jordan in its response to the Syrian refugee crisis, provide necessary assistance to support the basic needs of the assimilated Syrian refugees, cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat from ISIL or other terrorist organizations, and help secure the border between Jordan and Syria and Iraq. (Sec. 4) It is the sense of Congress that:

 expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to Jordan is fully consistent with U. S. security and foreign policy interests and the objectives of world peace and security; and it is in the interest of peace and stability for regional members of the Global Coalition to Combat ISIL to increase their involvement in addressing the ISIL threat. (Sec. 5) The Arms Export Control Act is amended to include Jordan among the countries eligible for certain streamlined defense sales for three years.

(Sec. 6) The Department of State is authorized to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Jordan to increase economic support funds and military cooperation, including joint military exercises, personnel exchanges, support for international peacekeeping missions, and enhanced strategic dialogue.</summary>
