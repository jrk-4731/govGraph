Women's Public Health and Safety Act

&#160;

(Sec. 2) This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to modify requirements regarding a state plan for medical assistance.&#160; Under current law, a state plan for medical assistance must provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain required services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to perform them.&#160; The bill specifies that a state may not be required to provide medical assistance for services furnished by any individual or entity based on the individual's or entity's involvement in abortions.</summary>
