  <summary date="2015-07-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 to increase from $18.75 billion to $23.5 billion the FY2015 funding available to the Small Business Administration (SBA) for general business loans authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act.

 The bill prohibits the SBA from guaranteeing a loan on and after October 1, 2015, if:

 the lender determines that the borrower is unable to obtain credit elsewhere solely because the lender's liquidity depends upon the guaranteed portion of the loan being sold on the secondary market, or the sole purpose for requesting the guarantee is to allow the lender to exceed its legal lending limit. The bill also requires the SBA to submit quarterly reports to Congress regarding the loan programs carried out under this section.</summary>
