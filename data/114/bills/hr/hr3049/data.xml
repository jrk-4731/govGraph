 Highlights: 

The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 provides FY2016 appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA), except for the Forest Service; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The mandatory funding levels are generally set by authorizing legislation such as the farm bill and are frequently limited in the agriculture appropriations bill.

The bill decreases discretionary funding for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies below FY2015 levels.

Compared to FY2015 levels, the bill

 decreases discretionary spending for Agricultural Programs, Conservation Programs, Domestic Food Programs, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs; and increases discretionary funding for Rural Development and the FDA. Also included in the bill are provisions that affect policy in areas such as:

 pre-market review and reporting requirements for tobacco products, imports of beef from Brazil and Argentina, the use of imported processed poultry from China for the school lunch and other nutrition programs, and the 2015 dietary guidelines. Full Summary:
