  <summary date="2015-05-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthening Privacy, Oversight, and Transparency Act or the SPOT Act

Amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to expand the functions of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) to include reviews of legislation, regulations, policies, and executive branch actions relating to foreign intelligence.

Allows intelligence community employees, contractors, or detailees to submit to the PCLOB a whistleblower complaint or information believed to be related to a privacy or civil liberties concern. Permits the PCLOB to: (1) investigate such complaints, or (2) transmit such complaints to any other executive agency or the congressional intelligence committees.

Authorizes the PCLOB to subpoena persons (other than agencies and elements of the executive branch) to produce documentary or testimonial evidence. (Currently, the PCLOB submits a request for the Attorney General to issue a subpoena.)

Permits the PCLOB, at the direction of the majority of its members, to exercise the authority of the PCLOB chairman to appoint and fix compensation of Board staff when the position of chairman is vacant.

Provides for members of the PCLOB to serve in a full-time capacity. Removes exceptions to the requirement that members continue to serve after the expiration of their term of office until a successor has been appointed and qualified. Revises the compensation of the PCLOB chairman, members, and staff.

Directs the Attorney General to fully inform the PCLOB about government activities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), including by providing to the PCLOB copies of: (1) FISA reports submitted to Congress; and (2) FISA court decisions, orders, and opinions that include significant construction or interpretation of FISA.</summary>
