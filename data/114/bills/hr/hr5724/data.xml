This bill amends the Revised Statutes and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to state that bank loans that are valid when made as to their maximum rate of interest in accordance with federal law shall remain valid with respect to that rate regardless of whether a bank has subsequently sold or assigned the loan to a third party. (Under these laws, interest may be charged on loans to customers at the greater of: (1) a rate not more than 1% above the discount rate on 90-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve Bank for the district in which the lender is located, or (2) the highest rate allowed by the laws of the state in which the lender is located.)</summary>
