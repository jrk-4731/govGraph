(Under these laws, interest may be charged on loans to customers at the greater of: (1) a rate not more than 1% above the discount rate on 90-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve Bank for the district in which the lender is located, or (2) the highest rate allowed by the laws of the state in which the lender is located.)"
