This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a taxpayer to accelerate the American Opportunity Tax Credit for qualified tuition and related expenses. A taxpayer may elect to receive the full amount of the credit over the first two years of postsecondary education rather than the four-year period required under current law. Such an election is irrevocable, applies for all subsequent tax years, and may not be made for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2022.

The Department of the Treasury must submit to Congress reports that include: the election rate, the demographics of the students making the elections, and an assessment of the effectiveness of the elections and the tax credit in improving college completion times.</summary>
