Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act or the DHS Interoperable Communications Act

(Sec. 3) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among DHS components.

(Sec. 4) Requires the Under Secretary to submit to the House and Senate homeland security committees a strategy for achieving and maintaining such communications, including for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies, that includes:

 an assessment of interoperability gaps in radio communications among the DHS components; information on DHS efforts and activities, since November 1, 2012, and planned, to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; an assessment of obstacles and challenges to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications; information on, and an assessment of, the adequacy of mechanisms available to the Under Secretary to enforce and compel compliance with interoperable communications policies and directives of DHS; guidance provided to DHS components to implement such policies and directives; the total amount of DHS expenditures since November 1, 2012, and projected future expenditures to achieve interoperable communications; and dates upon which DHS-wide interoperability is projected to be achieved for voice, data, and video communications, respectively, and interim milestones. Directs the Under Secretary to submit with such strategy information on: (1) any intra-agency effort or task force that has been delegated responsibilities relating to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications by such dates; and (2) who, within each component, is responsible for implementing policies and directives issued by the Under Secretary to achieve and maintain interoperable communications.

(Sec. 5) Directs the Under Secretary, within 100 days after the strategy is submitted and every 2 years thereafter for 6 years, to submit reports on the status of efforts to implement such strategy, including: (1) progress on interim milestones; (2) information on establishment by the Under Secretary of, and compliance of DHS components with, policies, directives, guidance, and training to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; and (3) information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary.</summary>
