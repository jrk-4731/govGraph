  <summary date="2015-01-21T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Export American Natural Gas Act of 2015

 Amends the Natural Gas Act to direct the Secretary of Energy to either approve or deny an application to export liquefied natural gas (LNG), whether through an onshore or offshore terminal, within 60 days after the later of: (1) receiving a completed application; (2) the applicant's contracting with a customer for the LNG proposed to be exported, and (3) the date of the enactment of this Act.

Deems the application approved if the Secretary has neither approved nor denied it by such 60-day deadline.

Declares this Act inapplicable to applications for export to a nation to which export is prohibited by law. Directs the Secretary of State to report to Congress on: (1) how the economic policies of foreign countries with natural gas resources and reserves relate to the development and production of their natural gas resources and reserves, as well as the extent and status of their natural gas resources and reserves; (2) the potential of such countries to export their natural gas production to the global market, including the impact of such exports upon the global market; and (3) U.S. actions to foster natural gas exports to foreign countries having an interest in importing natural gas from the United States.</summary>
