  <summary date="2015-06-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Equality in Insurance Act of 2015 

This bill requires an insurer, when rating and underwriting any insurance policy that takes into consideration the marital status of the proposed insured, to consider the proposed insured to be married if the proposed insured is in a legal marriage, a civil union, or a domestic partnership with substantially the same legal obligations and consequences as a legal marriage under the laws of any jurisdiction (including any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or any foreign jurisdiction).

Any person aggrieved by a violation of this Act may bring a civil action for damages and relief, including equitable relief.</summary>
