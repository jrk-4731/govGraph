This bill provides $1 billion in FY2016 supplemental appropriations to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for making a grant to the state of Michigan to replace pipes, pipe fittings, and other drinking water infrastructure that are not lead-free.

The funds are designated as an emergency requirement, which exempts the funds from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules. The EPA must report monthly to Congress on the use of the funds.</summary>
