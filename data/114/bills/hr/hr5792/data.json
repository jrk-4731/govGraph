Each agency shall prioritize amounts within such fund to be used initially for cost savings activities approved by the Federal Chief Information Officer.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall report on the implementation and operation of each such fund, current practices compared with industry best practices for the effective oversight and governance of a cloud computing working capital fund, the basis for the fund's use and operation, the fund's efficacy to accelerate technology transitions, and recommendations for improvement."
