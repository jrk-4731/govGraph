This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require tax-exempt organizations to file their returns in electronic form. The Internal Revenue Service must make the returns available to the public in a machine readable format as soon as practicable.

Upon the request of the Department of Justice (DOJ), states must make available information on charities or charity management officials who have been convicted of fraud, theft, or a financial offense. DOJ must: (1) establish a database that lists each such charity or charity management official, and (2) provide the information to state attorneys general for regulatory and law enforcement purposes.</summary>
