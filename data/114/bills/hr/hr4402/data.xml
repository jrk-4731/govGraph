(Sec. 2) This bill directs the President, through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to initiate a review of known instances since 2011 in which a person has traveled or attempted to travel to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria from the United States to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization.

 Such review shall:

 include relevant information held by the U.S. government related to each instance; ascertain factors that may have undermined efforts to prevent such travel, including the timely identification of suspects, information sharing, intervention, and interdiction; and identify lessons learned and areas for improvement to prevent additional travel by such persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. DHS shall submit to Congress the results of such review, which may include information on travel routes of greatest concern.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act.</summary>
