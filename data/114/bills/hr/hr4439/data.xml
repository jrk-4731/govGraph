This bill requires that certain public buildings that are open to the public and contain a public restroom&#160;provide a lactation room, other than a bathroom, that is hygienic and is available for use by a member of the public to express milk. The lactation room must be shielded from public view, be free from intrusion, and contain a chair, a working surface, and (if the building is&#160;supplied with electricity)&#160;an electrical outlet.</summary>
