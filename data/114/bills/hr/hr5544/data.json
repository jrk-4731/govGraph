DOJ must comply with notice requirements. An individual may bring a civil action in federal court seeking removal from the TSDB.\n\nAdditionally, the NICS database must notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation if a licensed gun dealer requests a background check on a prospective gun buyer who is or has been under a federal terrorism investigation."
