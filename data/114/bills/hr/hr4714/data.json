Under current law, Medicare covers routine costs of care furnished to a beneficiary enrolled in a category A (experimental) clinical trial of a medical device intended for use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of an immediately life-threatening disease or condition. The bill requires Medicare to also cover,\u00a0with respect to\u00a0a beneficiary enrolled in a category B (non-experimental) clinical trial, routine costs of care as well as the cost of the device under investigation.\n\nA trial of a medical device shall, for purposes of Medicare coverage,\u00a0be deemed to meet the definition of a category A or category B clinical trial, as the case may be, if the trial is conducted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's investigational use exemption."
