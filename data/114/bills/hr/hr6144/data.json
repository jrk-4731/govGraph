The Office of Management and Budget must publish guidelines to require: (1) the baseline budget of each department or agency to be assumed to be zero, and (2) each proposed expenditure to be justified as if it were new.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must revise a study of mandatory spending required under current law at least every five years."
