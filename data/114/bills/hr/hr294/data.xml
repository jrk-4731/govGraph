  <summary date="2015-03-02T13:33:16Z" status="Passed House amended">Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act

(Sec. 2) Authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), during the three-year period beginning on October 1, 2015, at the request of a veteran for whom the VA is required to provide nursing home care, to place such veteran in a medical foster home that meets VA standards. Requires such veteran to agree, as a condition of such placement, to accept VA home health services.

Limits the number of veterans placed in a medical foster home that may have their care covered at the expense of the United States to 900.

Amends the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to reduce the aggregate amount of awards and bonuses that may be paid by the VA in each of FY2015-FY2018 to $300 million.</summary>
