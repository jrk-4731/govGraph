    "text": "Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2016 or the CASE Act of 2016\n\nThis bill establishes in the U.S. Copyright Office a small claims board to serve as an alternative forum for parties to voluntarily seek to resolve certain copyright claims if the total monetary recovery sought by a party does not exceed $30,000.\n\nThe board is authorized to: (1) conduct hearings and conferences to facilitate parties' settlement of claims and counterclaims; (2) render independent determinations based on copyright laws and regulations; (3) award monetary relief; and (4) require cessation or mitigation of infringing activity, including the takedown or destruction of infringing materials, where the parties agree.\n\nThe bill preserves the right of parties to instead pursue a claim or defense in court.\n\nBoard proceedings shall not require in-person appearances by parties. Proceedings may take place through Internet-based teleconference applications.\n\nDiscovery shall be limited to the production of relevant information and documents, written interrogatories, and written requests for admission. But the board may consider a party's request for additional limited discovery.\n\nA party may request: (1) the claims board to reconsider its determinations, and (2) the Register of Copyrights to review a claims board determination if the board denies reconsideration.\n\nA final determination precludes relitigation of the claims before a court or the board, but parties may apply for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to vacate, modify, or correct a determination that: (1) was issued as a result of fraud, corruption, misrepresentation, or misconduct; (2) exceeds the board's authority or fails to render a definite determination; or (3) was based on a default determination or failure to prosecute that was due to excusable neglect.\n\nIf a party fails to pay or comply with relief awarded in a final board determination, the aggrieved party may apply for a court order confirming the final award."
