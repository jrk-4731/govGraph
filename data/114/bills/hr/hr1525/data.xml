Disclosure Modernization and Simplification Act of 2015

 (Sec. 2) Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue regulations permitting issuers to submit a summary page on annual and transition report form 10-K if each item on that page cross-references electronically or otherwise the material contained in form 10-K to which the item relates.

(Sec. 3) Requires the SEC to revise regulation S-K (Standard Instructions for Filing Forms under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975) in order to:

 reduce the burden on smaller issuers, including emerging growth companies, accelerated filers, and smaller reporting companies (while still providing all material information to investors); and eliminate duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or unnecessary provisions. (Sec. 4) Directs the SEC to study ways to: (1) modernize and simplify requirements in regulation S-K, and (2) evaluate information delivery and presentation methods as well as explore methods to discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information.

Requires the SEC to issue a proposed rule to implement any recommendations it makes to Congress based upon the study.</summary>
