Collected amounts are made available for the HHS grants in this bill.\n\nSpecified agencies must submit to the Office of E-Government and Information Technology of the Office of Management and Budget an inventory of agency data centers and a strategy to consolidate and optimize the data centers.\n\nThe bill revises reporting requirements for the Department of Defense (DOD) regarding data centers. DOD and the Director of National Intelligence may waive this bill's data center requirements for any national security system.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements for the Office of E-Government and Information Technology, including that the office must publish a goal for cost savings and optimization.\n\nThe bill's provisions regarding data centers are repealed at the start of FY2021."
