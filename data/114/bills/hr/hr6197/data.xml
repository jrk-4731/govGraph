This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to make eligible for deferment and cancellation under the Federal Direct Loan program a borrower who is an employee or founder of a small business start-up in a distressed area.

It also amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from an individual's gross income the amount of such canceled student loan debt.

The bill establishes a Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan program to refinance private education loans.

Finally, it establishes a young entrepreneurs business center within the Small Business Administration to certify small business start-ups, identify distressed areas, and approve loan cancelation for founders of small business start-ups.</summary>
