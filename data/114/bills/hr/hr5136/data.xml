This bill amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to prohibit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from submitting legislative or regulatory recommendations without an economic analysis by the FTC's Bureau of Economics sufficient to demonstrate that: (1) the FTC has identified a problem it determines should be addressed, including the rationale for the FTC's determination that private markets or public institutions could not adequately address the issue; and (2) the recommendation is based on a reasoned determination that its benefits outweigh its costs.</summary>
