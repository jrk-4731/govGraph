    "text": "North Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act \n\nThis bill authorizes the Department of Commerce to promulgate regulations to implement the Convention on the Conservation and Management of the High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean for the United States, which was adopted in Tokyo, Japan, on February 24, 2012. (The Convention establishes a regional fisheries management organization to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fisheries resources while protecting the marine ecosystems in the Convention Area.)\n\nThe United States has to be represented on the North Pacific Fisheries Commission by five commissioners that are selected in accordance with the requirements of the bill.\n\n Commerce must develop a memorandum of understanding with the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to clarify the role of each Council with respect to participating in or working with U.S. delegations to international fishery organizations and making recommendations related to fishery resources in the Convention Area.\n\n The Department of State's authority and responsibilities with respect to the Commission is established.\n\nAny regulation promulgated by Commerce to implement a measure adopted by the Commission that would govern a straddling stock under the authority of a Council must be approved by the Council. A straddling stock is a stock of fisheries resources which migrates between, or occurs in, the economic exclusion zone of one or more parties to the Convention and the Convention Area.\n\n Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security have to administer and enforce the bill, except to the extent otherwise provided for in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n\n Certain fishing and shipping acts in the Convention Area are prohibited.\n\n Commercial fishing vessels must meet certain notification requirements before entering or transiting the exclusive economic zone of the Convention Area, if the vessels do not carry vessel monitoring systems capable of communicating with U.S. enforcement authorities."
