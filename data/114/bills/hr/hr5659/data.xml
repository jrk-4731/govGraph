Expanding Seniors Receiving Dialysis Choice Act of 2016 or the ESRD Choice Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to allow individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to be eligible for Medicare Advantage (MA). Under current law, only individuals who develop ESRD while already enrolled in an MA plan may be considered eligible.

With respect to payment, the bill: (1) shifts responsibility for the cost of kidney acquisitions from MA plans to Medicare's fee-for-service program, and (2)&#160;excludes&#160;such costs&#160;from the calculation of certain benchmarks that&#160;form the basis for payment under MA plans.</summary>
