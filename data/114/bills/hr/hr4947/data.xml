This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to establish the National Commission on Catastrophe Preparation and Protection to advise it regarding estimated loss costs associated with contracts for reinsurance coverage.

Treasury may make homeowners protection coverage available through contracts for reinsurance coverage. Only eligible state programs may purchase such coverage.

Each contract for reinsurance coverage shall furnish insurance coverage against residential property losses to homes, including condominium and cooperative ownership, and the contents of apartment buildings.

The bill prescribes a minimum level of retained losses and maximum federal liability.

Any insurer who participates in an eligible state program may establish a Catastrophe Capital Reserve Fund to hold funds on Treasury's behalf to offset reinsurance claims.

The bill establishes the Consumer Hurricane, Earthquake, Loss Protection (HELP) Fund to: (1) make payments to covered purchasers under contracts for reinsurance coverage for eligible losses, and (2) pay for Commission operating costs and reinsurance program administrative expenses.</summary>
