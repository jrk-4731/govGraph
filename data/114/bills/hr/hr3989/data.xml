(Sec. 2) This bill permits an individual to elect to have an independent contractor perform an external clinical review of any of the following:

 a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) denial of an individual's application to be a caregiver or family caregiver eligible for VA benefits; with respect to an approved application, a VA determination of the level or amount of personal care services that a veteran requires; a request by a caregiver or family caregiver for a reconsideration of the level or amount of personal care services that a veteran requires based on post-application changes; and a revocation of benefits by the VA. The VA shall ensure that each external clinical review is completed and the individual is notified in writing of the results within 120 days of the election.

(Sec. 3) The VA shall issue policy, procedural, and operational directives for the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers and the program of general caregiver support services, including with respect to eligibility. The Government Accountability Office must report on VA processes for making and adjudicating eligibility determinations.

(Sec. 4) The bill amends the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to revise the limits on the aggregate amount of awards and bonuses payable to VA employees in each of FY2017-FY2021.</summary>
