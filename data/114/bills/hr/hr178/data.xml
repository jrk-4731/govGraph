  <summary date="2015-01-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Terrorist Denaturalization and Passport Revocation Act 

 Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include among the grounds for loss of U.S. nationality by a native-born or naturalized citizen:

 taking an oath or making a declaration of allegiance to a foreign terrorist organization after attaining the age of 18; entering or serving in the armed forces of a foreign state that harbors a foreign terrorist organization; accepting, serving in, or performing the duties of any office, post, or employment in a foreign terrorist organization after attaining the age of 18; accepting, serving in, or performing the duties of any office, post, or employment in a foreign terrorist organization after attaining the age of 18 for which an oath or declaration of allegiance is required; or accepting, serving in, or performing the duties of any office, post, or employment in a foreign terrorist organization after attaining the age of 18 if the position requires knowing engagement in hostilities against U.S. military or civilian personnel. Amends the Passport Act of 1926 to prohibit, with a discretionary exception for emergency or humanitarian reasons, the Secretary of State from issuing a passport or passport card to an individual who is a member of a foreign terrorist organization engaged in hostilities against the United States or its allies.

Directs the Secretary to revoke a passport or passport card previously issued to any such individual.

Authorizes the Secretary, before revocation, to: (1) limit a previously issued passport or passport card only for return travel to the United States, or (2) issue a limited passport or passport card that only permits return travel to the United States.</summary>
