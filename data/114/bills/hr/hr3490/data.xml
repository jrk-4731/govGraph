(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a National Computer Forensics Institute to be operated by the U.S. Secret Service to: (1) &#160;disseminate homeland security information related to the investigation and prevention of cyber and electronic crimes and related threats; and (2) educate, train, and provide equipment to state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges to carry out investigations, prosecutions, and court proceeding relating to such crimes and threats.

The institute:

 must provide education and training on investigation methods, computer and mobile device forensic examinations, network intrusion incidents, and methods to obtain, process, store, and admit digital evidence in court; must ensure that timely, actionable, and relevant expertise and homeland security information related to cyber and electronic crimes and threats is shared with such officers, prosecutors, and judges; and may provide officers, prosecutors, and judges with computer equipment and tools for such investigations and examinations. The Secret Service's network of Electronic Crime Task Forces is to be expanded through the addition of task force officers, prosecutors, and judges educated and trained at the institute, in addition to academia and private sector stakeholders.

The institute must seek opportunities to coordinate with the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center within DHS to help enhance the center's training for such cyber and electronic crimes and threats.</summary>
