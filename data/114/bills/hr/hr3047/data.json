The Department of Health and Human Services is required to reduce by 15% of the state TANF grant if a state has substantially failed to condition benefits on passing drug testing or screening.\n\nThe Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 are amended to set forth analogous drug testing and screening requirements under the supplemental nutrition assistance program and public housing and \"Section 8\" rental assistance programs."
