This bill provides that a state or local government is an ineligible jurisdiction if it: (1) restricts any government entity or official from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status, (2) otherwise restricts compliance with a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detainer, or (3) has any law or policy in effect that violates the immigration laws.

DHS shall annually determine whether each state or local government is an ineligible jurisdiction that may not receive any federal financial assistance for the fiscal year following any fiscal year in which DHS makes such determination.

A state or local government, and any law enforcement officer of such jurisdiction, acting in compliance with a DHS detainer shall be considered to be acting under color of federal authority for purposes of determining liability and immunity from suit in any federal or state civil action brought by an alien.

The Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to make it unlawful for a state or local government to discharge or discriminate against one of its law enforcement officers because such officer has taken any action to comply with a DHS detainer.</summary>
