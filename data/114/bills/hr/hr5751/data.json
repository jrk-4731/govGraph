They must collect, analyze, and disseminate data on the results of such management.\n\nThe Department of the Interior must issue as a final rule the draft rule entitled, \"Removing the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Maintaining Protections for the Mexican Wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) by Listing It as Endangered,\" as published on June 13, 2013.\n\nThe bill exempts the requirements and implementation of this bill from judicial review."
