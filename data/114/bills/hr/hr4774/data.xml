This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to increase, for purposes of Medicare payment,&#160;the otherwise applicable resident limit&#160;for&#160;qualifying hospitals. The bill establishes a process for distributing the new residency positions.

The bill eliminates the use of three-year rolling averages with respect to calculating, for purposes of Medicare payment, specified limits on certain new or redistributed residency positions.

With respect to&#160;specified hospitals, all of the time spent by an intern or resident in an approved medical residency training program, regardless of setting, shall be counted for purposes of determining a hospital's number of residents.

The bill revises payment rules for graduate medical education (GME) costs with respect to a hospital that establishes a new medical residency training program. With respect to a hospital that has not entered into a GME affiliation agreement, CMS shall establish the hospital's resident amount only after determining that the hospital trains more&#160;a specified number of&#160;residents. Similarly, CMS shall adjust a hospital's limitation on allopathic and osteopathic residents only after determining that the hospital&#160;trains&#160;more than a specified number of residents. In specified cases, CMS shall provide a hospital an opportunity to have its resident amount reestablished and its limitation adjustment re-determined.

The bill also revises provisions regarding: (1) aggregation rules relating to resident limits, and (2) the period of board eligibility for residents who change specialties.

CMS shall establish and implement procedures for adjusting a hospital's indirect medical education payments based on specified performance measures.</summary>
