This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in assessing research priorities, to publish data on certain clinical research study populations. The NIH must foster collaboration among clinical research projects that use human subjects and that collect similar data to increase the number and diversity of subjects.

The strategic plans of the national research institutes must ensure that future activities take into account women and minorities and are focused on reducing health disparities. Advisory council reports must include certain demographic data for clinical research subjects. The results of NIH-funded clinical trials that include women and minorities must be submitted to NIH's clinical trial data bank.

The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities may foster partnerships among the national research institutes and encourage the funding of collaborative research projects to achieve NIH goals related to minority health and health disparities.

The NIH must develop policies for NIH-funded basic research projects to assess how differences between male and female cells, tissues, or animals may be examined and analyzed.</summary>
