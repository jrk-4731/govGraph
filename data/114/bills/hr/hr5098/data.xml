The FTC's annual report about enforcement actions involving allegations of fraud targeting individuals who are 65 or older during the previous year must include:

 a description of each FTC enforcement action involving allegations of fraud against such individuals; the disposition of such enforcement actions, broken down by category; and the proportion of enforcement actions involving allegations of fraud against such individuals as a percentage of all enforcement actions relating to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce brought by the FTC.</summary>
