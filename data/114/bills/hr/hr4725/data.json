    "text": "Common Sense Savings Act of 2016\n\nThis bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to specify how a state must treat\u00a0qualified lottery winnings and lump sum income for purposes of determining an individual's income-based eligibility for a state Medicaid program. Specifically, a state shall include such winnings or income as income received: (1) in the month in which it was received, if the amount is less than $60,000; (2) over a period of two months, if the amount is at least $60,000 but less than $70,000; (3) over a period of three months, if the amount is at least $70,000 but less than $80,000; and (4) over an additional one-month period for each increment of $10,000 received, not to exceed 120 months.\n\nQualified lump sum income includes: (1) monetary winnings from gambling; (2) damages\u00a0received\u00a0in lump sums or periodic payments,\u00a0excluding monthly payments, on account of causes of action other than those arising from personal physical injuries or sickness; and (3) income received as liquid assets from the estate of a deceased individual.\n\nIn addition, the\u00a0bill eliminates the enhanced Federal\u00a0Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)\u00a0with respect to the coverage of\u00a0individuals who are inmates in public institutions.\u00a0Under current law, the enhanced FMAP\u00a0applies to coverage of individuals who are newly eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\n\nThe bill also amends title XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) of the SSAct to terminate increases to the enhanced FMAP as established by the PPACA with respect to CHIP.\n\nUnder current law, federal Medicaid reimbursement to states is reduced in proportion to any impermissible state taxes collected from health care providers. The bill lowers a percentage threshold used to determine whether such taxes are impermissible.\n\nThe bill terminates the Prevention and Public Health Fund."
