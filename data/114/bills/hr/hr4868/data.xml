  <summary date="2016-03-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Rural Main Street Investment Credit Act of 2016

 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for 35% of new investment in a rural microbusiness. There is a limit on such credit, for any rural microbusiness or any taxpayer, of $10,000 in a taxable year reduced by the amount allowed as a credit for all preceding taxable years.

A "rural microbusiness" is a trade or business that employs not more than five full-time employees in a taxable year and that is carried on, and physically located,&#160;in a distressed rural area. A "distressed rural area" as an area that has lost at least 5% of its population over the last 10 years or 10% of its population over the last 20 years, that has a median family income below 85 % of the national median family income, that has a poverty rate that exceeds 12.5%, or where average unemployment in the preceding year exceeds 120% of the national average.</summary>
