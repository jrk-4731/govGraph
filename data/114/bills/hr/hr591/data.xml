  <summary date="2015-01-28T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015

Directs the President to implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity and competitiveness through:

 advancing areas of research at the intersection of the biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering; supporting social science research that advances the field of engineering biology and contributes to the adoption of new products, processes, and technologies; expanding the number of researchers, educators, and students with engineering biology training; accelerating the translation and commercialization of engineering biology research and development by the private sector; and improving the interagency planning and coordination of federal government activities related to engineering biology. Directs the President to designate an interagency committee on engineering biology to oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program.

Requires the President to designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development to assess the progress being made in implementing the Program.

Directs the National Science Foundation to contract with the National Academies to convene a workshop to review the ethical, legal, environmental, and other appropriate societal issues related to engineering biology research and development.

Requires the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out specified research activities as part of the Program.</summary>
