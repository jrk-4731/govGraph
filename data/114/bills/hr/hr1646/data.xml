(Sec. 2) Directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) research how commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds, could be used to perpetuate an attack; and (2) develop policies, guidance, and protocols for DHS to prevent, or mitigate the risks of, such an attack. Authorizes DHS to provide the Departments of Defense, Transportation, and Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission information regarding how to best prevent and mitigate the risk of such an attack.

Requires DHS to: (1) disseminate to state, local, and tribal law enforcement officials and to state and major urban area fusion centers information regarding how such officials may bolster preparedness for, and responses to, attacks by such aircraft; and (2) submit an assessment of the security risk associated with such aircraft.</summary>
