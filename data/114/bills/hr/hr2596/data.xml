(Sec. 101) Authorizes FY2016 appropriations for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI); (2) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (3) Department of Defense (DOD); (4) Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (5) National Security Agency; (6) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (7) Coast Guard; (8) Departments of State, the Treasury, Energy (DOE), and Justice (DOJ); (9) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (10) Drug Enforcement Administration; (11) National Reconnaissance Office; (12) National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; and (13) Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

(Sec. 102) Specifies that the amounts authorized and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 2016, for such activities are those in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the congressional appropriations committees and the President.

(Sec. 103) Allows the DNI, if it provides prior notification to Congress, to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2016 when necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions.

Requires the DNI to establish guidelines to govern the treatment under such authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student or trainee program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long term, full-time training.

(Sec. 104) Authorizes FY2016 appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account, as well as for personnel positions for elements within such Account. Provides for funds identified in the classified schedule for advanced research and development to remain available until September 30, 2017.

TITLE II--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY SYSTEM

(Sec. 201) Authorizes FY2016 appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.

TITLE III--GENERAL PROVISIONS

Subtitle A--General Matters (Sec. 301) Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees to be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law.

(Sec. 302) Prohibits the authorization of appropriations by this Act from being deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or U.S. laws.

(Sec. 303) Prohibits initiation of a new special access program imposing access requirements for an intelligence-related activity or covert action that exceed those normally required for information at the same classification level, or of a transfer of funds from the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund or the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund to be used for intelligence activities, unless the DNI or DOD: (1) notifies Congress at least 30 days before initiating the program or transfer, or (2) waives such prohibition in an emergency situation and notifies Congress within 48 hours after initiation of the program or transfer.

(Sec. 305) Requires the DNI to designate an official to manage intelligence regarding the tactical use of tunnels by state and nonstate actors. Requires the DNI, within 10 months after enactment of this Act and biennially thereafter until four years after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress regarding: (1) trends in the use of tunnels by foreign state and nonstate actors, and (2) collaboration between the United States and partner countries to address the use of tunnels by adversaries.

(Sec. 306) Prohibits the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 from being construed to authorize the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to gain access to information that an executive branch agency deems related to covert action.

(Sec. 307) Requires the DNI to establish a formal internal reporting process for tracking requests for country clearance submitted to overseas DNI representatives by U.S. agencies.

(Sec. 308) Prohibits funds from being used to respond to or share any nonpublic information related to intelligence activities carried out by the United States in response to a legislative or judicial inquiry from a foreign government into U.S. intelligence activities.

(Sec. 309) Establishes a Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) within the Office of the DNI to: (1) serve as the primary organization within the federal government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the United States pertaining to cyber threats; (2) ensure that appropriate federal agencies have access to and receive all-source intelligence support needed to execute cyber threat intelligence activities and perform independent, alternative analyses; (3) disseminate cyber threat analysis to the President and appropriate federal agencies and congressional committees; and (4) coordinate cyber threat intelligence activities and strategic planning for the federal government.

Requires the CTIIC, within 10 months after enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for three years, to report to Congress regarding cyber threat trends and recommendations for better collaboration between federal agencies, including DOD, DOJ, and DHS.

(Sec. 310) Transfers from the DNI's Director of the Office of Business Transformation to the Chief Information Officer of the Intelligence Community the responsibility to make the certifications necessary to obligate funds for an intelligence community business system transformation that will have a total cost in excess of $3 million. Removes a requirement that the certifications for such a transformation be approved by a DNI governance board. Deems certified transformations to be in compliance with defense business system requirements.

(Sec. 311) Includes the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community within the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.

(Sec. 312) Authorizes inspectors general of the CIA and the intelligence community to request information or assistance from state or local governmental agencies.

(Sec. 315) Requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to permit grant recipients under the Urban Area Security Initiative or the State Homeland Security Grant Program to work in conjunction with DOE's national laboratories when grant funds are used to achieve target preparedness capabilities for federal, state, local, and tribal governments to respond to acts of terrorism under guidelines required by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006.

(Sec. 316) Makes technical amendments to exclude the Office of the DNI from certain position classification, pay, and allowances provisions relating to General Schedule employees.

(Sec. 317) Includes certain Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education among the minority-serving institutions eligible for DNI grants to provide programs of study for individuals to learn advanced foreign languages, study abroad, or develop other skills that meet the needs of the intelligence community.
