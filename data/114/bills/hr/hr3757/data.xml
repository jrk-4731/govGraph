This bill declares that the obligation to pay the basic pay of Members of Congress may not be satisfied if the U.S. public debt reaches the public debt limit until: (1) all other obligations of the U.S. government then due have been satisfied; or (2) if earlier, the ability of the U.S. Treasury to satisfy such obligations in a timely manner is restored, whether by an increase in the public debt limit or otherwise.

Each Member of Congress consents and agrees that payment of basic pay in accordance with this Act shall constitute a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands for service as a Member during the period covered by the payment.</summary>
