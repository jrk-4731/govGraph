  <summary date="2015-12-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">IRGC Sanctions Act

This bill amends the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require congressional approval of any rescission of a determination that a country is a state sponsor of terrorism.

The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to prohibit a U.S. person from knowingly engaging in any financial transaction with or transfer of funds to:

 Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or any IRGC subdivision; any person that is an agent, alias, front, instrumentality, or affiliate of any such entity; any person owned or controlled by such an entity or such a person; any natural person who is a representative, official, or senior member of any such entity; or any person for the purpose of avoiding a financial transaction with, or transfer of funds to, such an individual or entity, or for the benefit of such an individual or entity. The President shall exercise specified authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to carry out this Act, except that the President shall:

 not issue any general license authorizing, or otherwise authorize, any prohibited activity; or require any U.S. person seeking to engage in a prohibited financial transaction or transfer of funds to submit a written request to the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Congressional approval shall be required to remove any person added to the Office's list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons pursuant to this Act.

A person that violates prohibited activities shall be subject to specified penalties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

The President shall establish and update a watch list of persons that:

 meet certain criteria under this Act and are not included on the Office's list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons, and are Iranian persons that meet specified criteria under this Act and have been removed from the Office's list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons in accordance with the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The President may remove a person on the watch list under specified conditions.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require securities issuers to report to the Securities Exchange Commission any transaction prohibited by this Act.</summary>
