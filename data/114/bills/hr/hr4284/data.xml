Service Provider Opportunity Clarification Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue regulations providing examples of activities that would be considered a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements imposed on any entity (other than a small business) awarded a prime contract exceeding $500,000 (or exceeding $1 million if for construction of a public facility) that contains an SBA clause that:

 notifies potential offering companies of SBA requirements relating to contracts awarded pursuant to the negotiated method of procurement; or requires any bidder selected for a contract reward to submit to the appropriate federal agency a subcontracting plan which incorporates specified SBA information.</summary>
