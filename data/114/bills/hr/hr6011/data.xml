  <summary date="2016-09-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">ACA Premium Payment Verification Act

This bill conditions any advance payment of premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act upon certification that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has in place an adequate process to independently verify that an individual is enrolled under a qualified health plan (QHP) and has paid the plan premium. Such a process must satisfy specified requirements with respect to automation, effectiveness, and cooperation between CMS and the Department of the Treasury. Furthermore, such a process shall not be considered adequate to the extent that it includes any procedures that rely on assurances or attestations of the issuer of the QHP involved.</summary>
