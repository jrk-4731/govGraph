Such a process must satisfy specified requirements with respect to automation, effectiveness, and cooperation between CMS and the Department of the Treasury. Furthermore, such a process shall not be considered adequate to the extent that it includes any procedures that rely on assurances or attestations of the issuer of the QHP involved."
