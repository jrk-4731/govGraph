Cross-Border Rail Security Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to report to Congress on:

 the number of high-risk rail shipments annually entering the United States; the status of radiation detection units at each rail crossing on the northern and southern land borders of the United States; an assessment of whether additional radiation detection equipment is necessary to ensure that all high-risk cross-border rail shipments are examined with appropriate equipment; and a plan for ensuring that all relevant CBP personnel receive adequate training and guidance on the proper use of CBP's Automated Targeting System for such shipments, the use of appropriate radiation detection equipment for shipment examination, and requirements for recording examination results. The General Accountability Office shall periodically audit CBP operations at rail crossings on such borders to ensure that rail shipments are targeted and examined and that the examination results are properly documented.</summary>
