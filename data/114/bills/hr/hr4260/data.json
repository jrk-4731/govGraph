    "text": "Servicemember Higher Education Protection Act\n\nThis bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify provisions related to student loans\u00a0for members of the military and their spouses.\n\nThe Department of Education (ED) shall make available a simplified disclosure and enrollment form for student loan borrowers who are performing eligible military service.\n\nThe bill establishes, within the office of the Student Loan Ombudsman, a military and veteran point of contact.\n\nThe bill modifies processes for determining disability\u00a0with respect to\u00a0discharging a borrower's student loans. A borrower whose loan is discharged under these processes\u00a0shall not be subject to certain reinstatement provisions.\n\nUnder current law, borrowers serving on active duty are eligible for certain student loan interest subsidies and deferment. The bill extends such eligibility\u00a0to borrowers performing\u00a0other specified\u00a0military service and their spouses.\n\nThe bill\u00a0specifies how lump sum payments made through eligible repayment programs shall be treated for purposes of determining a borrower's eligibility for public service loan forgiveness.\n\nWithout requiring a request from the borrower, ED\u00a0must ensure that certain student loan interest does not accrue for an eligible military borrower serving in an area of hostilities.\n\nWith respect to the National Student Loan Data System, ED must: (1) integrate certain data related to the military and veteran status of borrowers, and (2) include information regarding Public Health Service loans.\n\nED shall use specified information to ensure that an active duty borrower\u00a0is not charged\u00a0interest in excess of a maximum rate on certain student loans.\n\nThe bill limits the allowable interest rate on certain student loan debt incurred during military service for the purpose of consolidating or refinancing student loans incurred before service.\n\nThe bill establishes a working group to improve\u00a0resources available from the Department of Defense's tuition assistance programs."
