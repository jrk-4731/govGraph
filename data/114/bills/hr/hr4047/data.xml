 This bill requires each fleet of a manufacturer of passenger automobiles (including light-duty motor vehicles) to comprise at least:

 30% qualified vehicles in model year 2018, and 50% qualified vehicles in model year 2019 and each subsequent year. A "qualified vehicle" is:

 a vehicle that operates on natural gas, hydrogen, or biodiesel; a flexible fuel vehicle capable of operating on gasoline, E85, and M85; a plug-in electric drive vehicle; or a vehicle propelled solely by fuel cell or by something other than an internal combustion engine. The bill authorizes a manufacturer to request an exemption from such requirement from the Department of Transportation.</summary>
