  <summary date="2015-10-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Social Security Garnishment Modernization Act of 2015

This bill limits the amount offset (i.e., withheld) from an individual's Social Security benefit payments to repay a defaulted federal student loan to the amount by which such Social Security benefit payments exceed $9,000 annually (i.e., $750 monthly), adjusted for inflation. 

Currently, the federal government may offset certain Social Security, railroad retirement, or black lung benefit payments to repay an individual's nontax federal debts, but the amount offset is limited to the amount of federal benefit payments that exceeds $9,000 annually, unadjusted for inflation.</summary>
