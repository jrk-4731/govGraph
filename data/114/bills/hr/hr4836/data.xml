  <summary date="2016-03-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to oppose any proposed IMF loan to a country about which an IMF staff analytical report finds no high probability that the country's public debt is sustainable in the medium term (currently, only if the proposed loan is not likely to be repaid in full).

The President may waive this requirement for purposes of U.S. national security interests.</summary>
