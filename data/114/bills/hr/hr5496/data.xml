This bill amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to make an employee eligible for coverage if that employee has been employed for at least 12 months by a covered employer from whom the leave is requested.

The bill repeals the current requirement that the employee have served at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period before the leave request.</summary>
