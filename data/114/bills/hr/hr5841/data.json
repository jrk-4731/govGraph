    "text": "This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to establish a five-year, population-based payment demonstration project through which provider networks are prospectively paid monthly capitated payments for coordinated care furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the project, a provider network must:\n\n be an integrated care system that provides Medicare services directly; include physicians in group practice arrangements, a federally qualified health center, and at least one hospital; enter into, and be responsible for making payments to providers under,\u00a0appropriate contractual arrangements; be accountable for the quality, cost, and overall care of the network's participating beneficiaries; enter into a participation agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); and meet other specified requirements. CMS shall establish a process\u00a0for prospectively assigning Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to a participating provider network. This process must allow beneficiaries to opt out of such assignment.\n\nThe bill limits Medicare payment for out-of-network services furnished to a participating beneficiary.\n\nTo calculate payments to participating networks, CMS shall: (1)\u00a0determine a base annual prospective population health budget, (2)\u00a0adjust such budget\u00a0to account for\u00a0the number and characteristics of participating beneficiaries with respect to each network, and (3) annually update the budget to account for population changes\u00a0and Medicare program growth.\n\nThe bill establishes certain limits on total program expenditures for the program's initial three years.\n\nCMS may expand the project's duration and scope under specified circumstances."
