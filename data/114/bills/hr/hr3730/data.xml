  <summary date="2015-10-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill makes E-3 nonimmigrant visas (specialty occupation) for Australian nationals that are unused during a fiscal year available on the same basis in the subsequent fiscal year to nationals of Ireland residing in Ireland.

The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to make eligible for an E-3 visa an alien who is a national of Ireland coming to the United States to perform services as an employee who has at least a high school education or its equivalent, or has, within five years, at least two years of work experience in an occupation classified as Zone 2 or higher by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</summary>
