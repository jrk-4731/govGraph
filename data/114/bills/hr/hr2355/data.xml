  <summary date="2015-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Women's Preventive Health Awareness Campaign

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide for a national public outreach and educational campaign, including a website, to raise awareness of women's preventive health.

The campaign must describe guidelines for women's preventive services, promote well-woman visits, explain the women's preventive services that are covered by health insurance without patient cost sharing, and address health disparities.

Well-woman visits that a health care provider determines a woman needs in order to obtain all necessary preventive services must be covered by health insurance without patient cost sharing.

Health insurers may limit coverage of women's preventive services where guidelines do not specify the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the services.

Cost sharing for a preventive health service provided by an out-of-network provider shall not be imposed if a woman does not have an in-network provider with the capacity to provide the service.

For a preventive health service that varies based on the patient's risk of disease, a woman must be treated as being at high risk for a disease if she has a family history of the disease or if a health care provider determines she is at high risk.

Requirements are described for women's preventive services coverage of breast cancer susceptibility screening, HIV testing, breastfeeding support, and contraception.

HHS must enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine (or another entity) to study and recommend the appropriate billing codes for a well-woman visit.</summary>
