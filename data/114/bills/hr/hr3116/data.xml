(Sec. 2) This bill extends the authority of the Department of Commerce to conduct the quarterly financial report program through September 30, 2030, under which Commerce collects and publishes quarterly financial statistics of business operations, organization, practices, management, and relation to other businesses, including data on sales, expenses, assets, liabilities, and other measures of financial condition.

(Sec. 3) Commerce must conduct and report to specified congressional committees on a review of the data security procedures of the Bureau of the Census. Such report shall:

 identify all Bureau information systems that contain sensitive information; describe any actions carried out by Commerce or the Bureau to secure sensitive information since the data breaches of Office of Personnel Management systems were announced in 2015; identify any known data breaches of Bureau information systems that contain sensitive information; and identify whether the Bureau stores any information that, if combined with other information, would comprise classified information.</summary>
