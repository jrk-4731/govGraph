    "text": "Moving Housing Forward Act of 2016\n\nThis bill directs the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to require the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to establish a pilot program that shares with the private sector the credit risk on a pool of single-family residential mortgage loans that back securities on which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest.\n\nThe bill expresses the sense of Congress that credit risk transfer transactions should be encouraged that: (1) reduce taxpayer exposure to credit risk assumed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and (2) do not expose Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to excessive counterparty risk that persons contractually obligated to them will fail to perform their obligations.\n\nAfter the pilot program is executed for three years, the FHFA must examine the economics of developing it into a continuous risk sharing program."
