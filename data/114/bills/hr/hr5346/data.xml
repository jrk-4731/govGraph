Securing our Agriculture and Food Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs to carry out a program to coordinate Department of Homeland Security (DHS) efforts related to defending the food, agriculture, and veterinary systems of the United States against terrorism and other high-consequence events that pose a high risk to homeland security.

Such program shall include:

 providing oversight and management of DHS's responsibilities pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 - Defense of United States Agriculture and Food; providing oversight and integration of DHS activities related to veterinary public health, food defense, and agricultural security; leading DHS policy initiatives relating to food, animal, and agricultural incidents and to overall domestic preparedness for, and collective response to, agricultural terrorism; coordinating with other DHS components, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection, on activities related to food and agriculture security and screening procedures for domestic and imported products; and coordinating with appropriate federal departments and agencies.</summary>
