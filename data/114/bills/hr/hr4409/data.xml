This bill directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish labels that persons or businesses may use voluntarily to indicate to consumers the extent to which products introduced, delivered for introduction, sold, advertised, or offered for sale in commerce are of U.S. origin.

The FTC must establish four categories of such labels, to be known as America Star labels, which may be used to designate products: (1) that satisfy the standard for an unqualified U.S. origin claim set forth by the FTC in the Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims; or (2) for which not less than 90%, 80%, or 70% of the total cost of manufacturing is attributable to U.S. costs.

The FTC must promulgate regulations for such labels and enforce such regulations under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

The bill also preempts certain state law requirements relating to the use of "Made in the U.S.A." or "Made in America" labels. The preemption provisions provide for: (1) the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to supersede state laws that impose more stringent requirements, and (2) FTC regulations under this bill to supersede state laws.</summary>
