This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for 50% of an individual's qualified infertility treatment expenses, subject to specified limits based on dollar amounts and the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Qualified infertility treatment expenses are amounts paid for the treatment of infertility via in vitro fertilization if such treatment is provided by a licensed physician, surgeon, or other medical practitioner and is administered with respect to a diagnosis of infertility by a physician licensed in the United States.</summary>
