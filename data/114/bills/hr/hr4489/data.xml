This bill reauthorizes Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) research and development (R&amp;D) programs for FY2016-FY2019.

The FAA shall appoint an Associate Administrator for Research and Development.

The FAA shall develop a plan in the event of the transition of FAA R&amp;D activities to a non-federal entity.

The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 is amended to revise requirements with respect to the FAA's five-year roadmap for the introduction of civil unmanned aircraft systems (drones) into the national airspace system.

The roadmap shall include, at a minimum, a description of how the FAA plans to use R&amp;D to integrate drones into the system.

The FAA shall coordinate with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to research the collision of drones with manned aircraft.

The FAA shall establish R&amp;D programs:

 to improve the cybersecurity of civil aircraft and the system, on civilian air traffic surveillance over oceans and other remote locations, and in support of single-piloted cargo aircraft with remote piloting and computer piloting. The FAA shall submit to Congress a research plan for certification and implementation of new technologies (including Next Generation) into the system.</summary>
