This bill amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to include gender-responsive services in the grant program for juvenile delinquency prevention.The bill defines "gender-responsive services" as practices and evidence-based services, including trauma-informed services and trauma-specific interventions, that comprehensively address the unique challenges that girls face in the juvenile justice system.

The bill adds, as requirements for delinquency prevention grant eligibility, that a unit of general local government provide statements of how funds will increase the effectiveness of plans and activities to be carried out under them.</summary>
