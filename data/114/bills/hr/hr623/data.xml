DHS Social Media Improvement Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a social media working group (the Group) to identify, and provide guidance and best practices to the emergency preparedness and response community on, the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a natural disaster or an act of terrorism or other man-made disaster.

Requires the Group to submit an annual report that includes:

 a review and analysis of social media technologies used to support preparedness and response activities; a review of best practices and lessons learned; recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media technologies for emergency management purposes, recommendations to improve public awareness of the type of information disseminated through such technologies, and recommendations on how to access such information during a disaster; a review of available training for government officials on the use of social media technologies in response to a disaster; and a review of coordination efforts with the private sector to discuss and resolve legal, operational, technical, privacy, and security concerns. Terminates the Group five years after the enactment of this Act unless the chairperson renews it for a successive five-year period by submitting a certification that the continued existence of the Group is necessary. Provides for successive five-year renewal periods.</summary>
