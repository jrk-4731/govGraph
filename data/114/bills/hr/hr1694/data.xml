Fairness to Veterans for Infrastructure Investment Act of 2015

 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to revise the requirement that 10% of the award of contracts for federal-aid highway, federal public transportation, and highway safety research and development programs be set-aside for small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. This set-aside must include veteran-owned small businesses.</summary>
