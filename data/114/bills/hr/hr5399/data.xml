Ethical Patient Care for Veterans Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that each VA physician is informed of the duty to report any covered activity committed by another physician that the physician witnesses or otherwise directly discovers to the applicable state licensing authority within five days.

 Disciplinary Appeals Boards shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review any case of professional conduct or competence arising from a VA physician's failure to properly report such activity.

"Covered activity" means any activity occurring in a VA medical facility that consists of or causes the provision of impaired, incompetent, or unethical health care that requires direct reporting under the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association.</summary>
