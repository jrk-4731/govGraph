This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to postpone implementation and enforcement of&#160;a local coverage determination (LCD) proposed by a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) on lower limb prostheses. (An LCD is a decision by a MAC, which is a private insurer that processes Medicare claims within a specified geographic&#160;jurisdiction, as to&#160;whether to cover a service on a MAC-wide basis.) The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid shall provide guidance and oversight related to LCDs, as specified by the bill.</summary>
