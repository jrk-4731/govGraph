These rules are applicable to the Federal Family Education Loan and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan programs, except for income-based repayment plans, and federal Perkins Loans.\n\nThe bill requires lenders to apply payments that are more than the monthly payment amount towards any outstanding fees owed and then towards the principal due on the loan that bears the highest interest rate. In addition, lenders must apply payments that are less than the monthly payment amount towards any outstanding fees owed and then towards the loan with the smallest balance of principal and interest combined unless the borrower requests otherwise."
