This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a tax-exempt parental leave savings account for the care of a child, to which an individual taxpayer who has earned income from employment during the past 12 months may make tax deductible cash contributions of up to $6,750 in a taxable year and not more than an aggregate of &#160;$24,000 for all taxable years. Taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 in a taxable year are ineligible for such a tax deduction.

The bill excludes from gross income: (1) distributions from a parental leave savings account that are made not later than one year after the birth or adoption of a child of an account holder, and (2) contributions made by an employer to the parental leave savings account of an employee.</summary>
