Office of Financial Research Accountability Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to require the Office of Financial Research within the Department of the Treasury to publish annually a detailed work plan of the Office priorities for the upcoming fiscal year, including a detailed description of the progress made by primary financial regulatory agencies in adopting a unique alphanumeric system ("Legal Entity Identifier") to identify legally distinct entities that engage in financial transactions, as well as a list of regulations requiring the use of such a system and actions taken to ensure its adoption by those agencies.

The bill requires the Office to develop and implement a cybersecurity plan using adequate safeguards to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data in Office possession.</summary>
