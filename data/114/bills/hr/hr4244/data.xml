  <summary date="2015-12-11T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Refugee Resettlement Fund Act of 2015

This bill permits an alien applying for U.S. refugee admission who is referred for resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) to be admitted only after the Department of the Treasury, in coordination with the revenue agency of the state in which the alien is to be resettled and a representative of the local government where the alien is to be resettled, determines that any admission and resettlement cost incurred by the federal, state, or local government is financed by a Refugee Resettlement Fund payment.

The bill establishes the Refugee Resettlement Fund in the Treasury, for deposit of only those amounts received from the UNHCR for refugee resettlement purposes.</summary>
