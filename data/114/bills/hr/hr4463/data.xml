  <summary date="2016-02-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Brownfields Reauthorization Act of 2016

This bill amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)to revise and reauthorize brownfields revitalization and state response program funding through FY2021.(Brownfields are certain commercial properties that are hindered from reuse or redevelopment due to the presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.)

The Environmental Protection Agency must establish a program to provide multipurpose grants to carry out inventory, characterization, assessment, planning, or remediation activities at one or more brownfield sites in a proposed area.

Certain nonprofit organizations and community development entities are made eligible for brownfields revitalization funding.

Grant or loan recipients may use up to 8% of brownfields revitalization funding for administrative costs.

Additionally, the bill revises the brownfield site characterization and assessment grant program to allow a governmental entity to receive a grant for property acquired prior to January 11, 2002, even if the entity does not qualify as a bona fide prospective purchaser under CERCLA.</summary>
