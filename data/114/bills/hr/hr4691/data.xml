This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to require a local educational agency (LEA), as a condition of receiving funds under the ESEA, to establish and implement a policy on allergy bullying that requires schools to:

 educate students, school personnel, and parents about allergy bullying; clearly define what the punishment or response may be for violating rules against allergy bullying; encourage each victim of allergy bullying to report the bullying to school personnel; and comply with&#160;the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in carrying out these requirements. An LEA shall&#160;certify annually that it has established and implemented such a policy.

"Allergy bullying" is an&#160;unwanted, aggressive behavior by a student toward another student who has&#160;an allergy, including: (1) a real or perceived imbalance of power due to the student's allergy; and (2) actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, making physical or verbal attacks, and purposefully excluding the student from a group.</summary>
