  <summary date="2015-05-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Furloughed Federal Employee Double Dip Elimination Act 

 Requires regulations pertaining to the compensation of a federal employee who receives back pay for a period in which such employee was furloughed due to a lapse in appropriations to ensure that such back pay be treated&#160;in the same way as federal wages attributable to such employee and that the period to which such back pay relates be treated in the same way as a period of federal service attributable to such employee (thereby disqualifying such employee for receipt of state unemployment compensation).</summary>
