    "text": "TechCorps Act\n\nThis bill requires the Office of Personnel Management to establish and maintain a database of job vacancies across the government relating to information technology (IT). The database shall be published on the USA Jobs website and describe such vacancies as TechCorps-eligible positions.\n\nThe National and Community Service Act of 1990 is amended to direct the Corporation for National and Community Service to enter into an agreement with a federal agency to carry out a TechCorps program, under which:\n\n individuals apply to service as TechCorps members prior to or after graduating from a program of study at an institution of education leading to a degree or certificate relating to IT, individuals are recruited by their last academic year in such a program, TechCorps members commit to employment with the federal agency in an IT-related job for at least two years, and individuals accepting such employment shall be TechCorps members for up to four years. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to provide that a borrower of a loan under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program shall be eligible to defer payments for any period during which the borrower is serving as a TechCorps member. The Department of Education shall carry out a program of canceling a specified amount of the loan obligation amount of borrowers who serve as TechCorps\u00a0members for at least two years and are not in default.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall study and report to Congress on projected staffing needs for IT-related jobs in government over the next 10 years."
