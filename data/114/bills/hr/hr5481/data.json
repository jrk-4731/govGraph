This bill allows an IHE to require any student DL program borrower to complete additional counseling on the terms, conditions, and responsibilities of a loan at or prior to its disbursement.\n\nAdditionally, it requires an IHE to ensure that student and parent DL program borrowers annually accept a loan affirmatively prior to the first disbursement of such loan."
