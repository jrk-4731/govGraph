DOJ must: (1) assign personnel and resources through task forces to investigate allegations of criminal offenses by federal contractors and employees overseas, and (2) report to Congress annually on the number of prosecutions and actions taken.\n\n This bill does not apply to the authorized intelligence activities of the U.S. government."
