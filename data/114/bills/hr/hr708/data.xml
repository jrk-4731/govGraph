  <summary date="2015-02-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Better On-line Ticket Sales Act of 2014 or the BOTS Act

Prohibits: (1) intentionally using or selling software to circumvent a security measure, access control system, or other control or measure on a ticket seller's Internet website that is used by the seller to ensure equitable consumer access to tickets for any given event; or (2) selling any ticket in interstate commerce knowingly obtained in violation of such prohibition.

Treats a violation as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Authorizes a person who suffers injury as a result of a violation of this Act to bring a civil action for damages plus $1,000 for each distinct use or sale of software, or sale of a ticket, that caused such injury and reasonable attorneys' fees.

Amends the federal criminal code to prescribe criminal penalties for such an offense.</summary>
