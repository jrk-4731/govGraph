This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to require public housing agencies to terminate the tenancy of families residing in public housing that have an income exceeding 125% of the area median income. The bill allows an exception to this requirement if, at the time of the termination, there are no families on the waiting list or applying for public housing administered by the agency.</summary>
