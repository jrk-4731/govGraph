  <summary date="2015-07-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">South Sudan Peace Promotion and Accountability Act of 2015

This bill states that Congress: (1) recognizes that there has been a failure of leadership in South Sudan that has left South Sudanese civilians in a protracted state of suffering, and that the United States stands in solidarity with the people of South Sudan as they call for peace; and (2) urges all parties in the conflict to cease all violence and work towards a negotiated settlement through diplomacy and reconciliation.

Specified sanctions imposed on individuals related to South Sudan shall remain in effect until the President certifies to Congress that such sanctions are no longer necessary.

Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit the President's authority to impose additional sanctions.

The President shall transmit to Congress a strategy to guide future U.S. engagement with South Sudan.</summary>
