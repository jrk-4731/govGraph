  <summary date="2016-05-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to revise its regulations establishing flammability standards for child restraint systems to measure the smolder ignition resistance, rather than the open flame flammability, of such systems. In revising such regulations, NHTSA must: (1) consider the standard and testing methodologies contained in the California Technical Bulletin entitled "Requirements, Test Procedure and Apparatus for Testing the Smolder Resistance of Materials Used in Upholstered Furniture"; and (2) consult the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the health effects and exposure risks associated with materials used in such restraint systems.</summary>
