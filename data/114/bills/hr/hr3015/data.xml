  <summary date="2015-07-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">EPA Regulatory Domestic Benefit Act of 2014 

 This bill prohibits the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from issuing, implementing, and enforcing any proposed or final rule addressing emissions of carbon dioxide from any new, existing, modified, or reconstructed electric power plant unless the regulatory impact analysis for the rule primarily considers, and separately reports on, the domestic benefits of the rule that are associated with the carbon dioxide emission reductions projected to occur under the rule.

The bill also nullifies the following proposed rules: (1) Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units, (2) Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units, and (3) Carbon Pollution Standards for Modified and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units.</summary>
