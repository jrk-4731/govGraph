This bill directs the Department of State to submit within 120 days a list of each foreign person that: (1) was at any time since January 1, 2015, involved in actions to unlawfully access, disrupt, influence, or alter information related to U.S. political parties, federal election candidates, or the administration of federal elections; or (2) acted as an agent of, or on behalf of, such foreign person.

The unclassified portion of such list shall be made available to the public and published in the Federal Register.

A listed alien shall be ineligible to receive a U.S. entry visa, and any current visa shall be revoked. Such prohibitions shall also apply to an alien who is an official of, or acting on behalf of, a listed foreign entity or government if such alien knowingly furthered such prohibited actions.

The President, through the Department of the Treasury, shall: (1) freeze and prohibit a listed foreign person's transactions in property and property interests that are in the United States or controlled a U.S. person, and (2) require each financial institution that is a U.S. person and has within its possession or control such property or property interests to certify that it has frozen all such assets.</summary>
