  <summary date="2015-02-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Road Usage Charge Pilot Program Act of 2015

 Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Road Usage Charge Pilot Program to make competitive grants to state or local governments, or metropolitan planning, regional transportation planning, or tribal organizations to conduct pilot studies on implementing mileage-based fee systems as a method for funding transportation highway projects.

Directs the Secretary to establish a working group to:

 develop national technology standards for a road usage charge, as well as national privacy standards for such a charge that balance the effectiveness of revenue systems with user privacy; and evaluate the potential of the methods studied in the program to manage demand and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.</summary>
