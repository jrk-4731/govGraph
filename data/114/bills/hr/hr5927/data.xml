This bill delays the date upon which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)&#160;may&#160;make Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings for hospitals publicly available.

With respect to such ratings, HHS shall: (1) make publicly available detailed information on the methodology used, (2) have the validity and accuracy of such methodology independently confirmed, and (3) provide a public comment period of specified duration.

HHS may not make the ratings publicly available until the later of July 31, 2017, or the date upon which the bill's requirements are satisfied.
