This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit tax refunds from being issued to prepaid debit cards, unless: (1) the Department of the Treasury has verified the identity of the account holder, and (2) the refund is issued no earlier than 21 days after the date on which the tax return is filed. Treasury must conduct the verification required by this bill in the same manner that is used to verify the identity of account holders suspected of being victims of identity theft.</summary>
