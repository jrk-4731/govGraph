  <summary date="2015-05-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish processes under which: (1) an entity seeking to develop patient experience data may submit initial research concepts for feedback; (2) the FDA may request or receive from such an entity draft guidance documents, data, and summaries and analyses of data; and (3) patient experience data may be considered in the risk-benefit assessment of a new drug.

&#8220;Patient experience data&#8221; is data collected by patients or others that is intended to facilitate the FDA's risk-benefit assessments, including information about the impact of a disease or a therapy on patients' lives.

The FDA must convene workshops and publish guidance on the patient experience data processes described above.</summary>
