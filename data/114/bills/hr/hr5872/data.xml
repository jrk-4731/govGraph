This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require mead and low alcohol by volume wine to be taxed at the same rate as still wines containing not more than 14% of alcohol by volume.

Mead is a wine that: (1) contains not more than 0.64 grams of carbon dioxide per hundred milliliters of wine with an exception for a limit that is reasonably necessary in good commercial practice, (2) is derived solely from honey and water, (3) contains no fruit product or fruit flavoring, and (4) contains less than 8.5% alcohol by volume.

A low alcohol by volume wine is a wine that: (1) contains not more than 0.64 grams of carbon dioxide per hundred milliliters of wine with an exception for a limit that is reasonably necessary in good commercial practice, (2) is derived primarily from grapes or from grape juice concentrate and water, (3) contains no fruit product or fruit flavoring other than grape, and (4) contains less than 8.5% alcohol by volume.</summary>
