  <summary date="2015-04-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cutting Costly Codes Act of 2015

This bill prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing, administering, or enforcing regulations that would replace ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases) with ICD-10 as a code set for financial and administrative transactions involving the electronic exchange of health information. ICD is a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases.

The Government Accountability Office must recommend steps to mitigate the disruption to health care providers that would result from replacement of ICD-9.</summary>
