This bill requires the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to conduct one oil and gas lease sale off North Carolina's coast every year for five years.

In addition, it protects military operations by allowing BOEM and the Department of Defense to mutually make certain areas off limits to exploration and allows coastal states to receive revenue from offshore energy projects.

This mandate shall take effect not later than two years after enactment of this bill.</summary>
