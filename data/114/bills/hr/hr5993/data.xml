This bill prohibits the use of funds: (1) for the official travel expenses of a Member of Congress or legislative branch employee for airline accomodations that are not coach-class, (2) for the long-term leasing of a vehicle by a Member of Congress, and (3) for a Member's official mail other than a document transmitted under official letterhead.

The bill amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to reduce the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress by 10%.

This bill excludes Members of Congress from further coverage under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). This exclusion does not apply to the Vice President.

Nothing in this bill shall: (1) be considered to nullify, modify, or otherwise affect any right, entitlement, or benefit under CSRS or FERS for any Member covering any period before its enactment; or (2) affect the eligibility of a Member to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan.

Members currently covered by CSRS or FERS may elect to retain such coverage by giving written notice within 90 days after enactment of this bill.</summary>
