This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop jointly a methodology that identifies which members of the Armed Forces and veterans are at high risk of suicide.

DOD and the VA shall use this information to: (1) identify which units that were deployed in support of a post-September 11, 2001, contingency operation have a disproportionately high rate of suicide and suicide attempts, and (2) provide additional mental health preventative and treatment resources for veterans who were so deployed.

The use of such information is restricted.</summary>
