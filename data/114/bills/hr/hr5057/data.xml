This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to require a VA employee (including a temporary full-time, part-time, or without-compensation employee) who is authorized to prescribe any controlled substance to complete at least one accredited continuing education course on pain management every two years.

Such requirement shall:

 apply to an employee who is employed by the VA for at least 180 days during any 24-month period; and not apply to an employee licensed or certified by a state licensure or specialty board that requires the completion of pain management or substance use disorder management continuing education. Continuing education courses shall include information on safe prescribing practices, controlled substance disposal, pain management principles, and identification of potential substance use disorders and addiction treatment.</summary>
