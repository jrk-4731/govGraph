(Sec. 4) The State Department shall offer to annually brief the appropriate congressional committees on efforts to implement such strategy.\n\n (Sec. 5) The President shall report within two years on progress made in implementing such strategy.\n\n(Sec. 6) The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended to eliminate from the State Department's Foreign Service workplace report descriptions of steps taken in furtherance of compatibility and the development of uniform procedures and consolidated personnel functions."
