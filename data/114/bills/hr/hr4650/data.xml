This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to delay by two additional years the application of negative payment adjustments under the "25-percent rule" to certain long-term care hospitals and satellite facilities. This rule reduces payments to a long-term care facility that admits proportionately more patients from any single hospital.</summary>
