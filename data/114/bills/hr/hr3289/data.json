All such requirements shall include consistent enforcement mechanisms for any operations not in compliance with them.\n\n Royalties otherwise authorized or required to be paid for natural gas shall be assessed on all gas produced under the mineral leasing laws, including:\n\n gas used or consumed within the area of a tract for the benefit of the lease (commonly referred to as \"beneficial use gas\"); and all gas consumed or lost by venting, flaring, or fugitive releases through any equipment during upstream operations. Exempted from assessment of these royalties is any natural gas:\n\n vented or flared in an acute emergency situation posing danger to human health that occurs for no more than 48 hours, or injected into the ground on a lease tract."
