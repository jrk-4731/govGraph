Partners for Aviation Security Act

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Transportation Security Administration to consult with the Aviation Security Advisory Committee regarding modifications to the prohibited item list before issuing a determination about them.

The prohibited item list is a list of items passengers are prohibited from carrying as accessible property or on their persons through passenger screening checkpoints at airports, into sterile airport areas, and on board passenger aircraft.

(Sec. 3) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall report to its Transportation Security Oversight Board and specified congressional committees general information on how often the Board has met, its current composition, and what activities it has undertaken, consistent with its duties. DHS may include in the report recommendations for changes to Board requirements.

 (Sec. 4) Committee member term requirements are revised to allow an expiring member's term to continue until a successor member begins serving on the Committee.</summary>
