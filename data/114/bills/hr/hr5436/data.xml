This bill amends the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 to revise the principal U.S. negotiating objectives regarding foreign investment to require any trade agreement between the United States and a foreign country to include a stipulation that, if the United States elects to deny the benefits of any dispute settlement claim relating to a U.S. law or other measure considered appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to U.S. human health objectives, then that claim shall be dismissible in any arbitration proceeding.</summary>
