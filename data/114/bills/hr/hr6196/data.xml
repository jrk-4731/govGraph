 This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to require communities participating in the national flood insurance program that have adopted land use control measures to: (1) analyze and map areas in which are located structures and public or nonprofit facilities that have been repetitively damaged by flooding; and (2) develop a community-specific plan for addressing continuing flood risks and make the plan, updates, and reports on progress in reducing flood risk publicly available.

FEMA shall provide sanctions upon communities that fail to comply with the requirements of this bill or to make sufficient progress in reducing the flood risks to areas repeatedly damaged by floods.</summary>
