This bill authorizes the Department of the Army to award the Army Combat Action Badge to a person who: (1) participated as a member of the Army between December 7, 1941, and September 18, 2001, in combat during which the person was personally engaged with the enemy; and (2) has not been recognized previously for such participation.

The Army may make arrangements with suppliers of the badge so that eligible persons may procure it directly from suppliers, thereby substantially reducing or eliminating administrative costs for carrying out this bill.</summary>
