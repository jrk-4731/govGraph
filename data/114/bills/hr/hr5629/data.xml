This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a California New River restoration program for the river that starts in Mexicali, Mexico, flows north into the United States through Calexico, passes through the Imperial Valley, and drains into the Salton Sea.

In carrying out the program, the EPA must: (1) adopt a New River-wide strategy, and (2) provide grants and technical assistance for coordinating restoration and protection activities.</summary>
