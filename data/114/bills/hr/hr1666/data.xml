  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Design-Build Efficiency and Jobs Act of 2015

Modifies criteria for the use of design-build selection procedures for civilian and defense contracts for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work. Requires the use of two-phase selection procedures (i.e., submission of qualifications and then the submission of price and technical proposals in response to a request for proposal) when a contracting officer determines that such a contract has a value of $750,000 or greater. Maintains current criteria for these contracts if a contracting officer determines that they have a value of less than $750,000.

Requires the contracting officer to provide written documentation of how more than five finalists in a solicitation for a contract is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection procedures.

Requires: (1) executive agencies to report on contracts for which more than five finalists were selected for phase-two requests or for which the contract was awarded without using two-phase selection procedures, and (2) the Government Accountability Office to report on the compliance of such agencies with design-build contract procedures.</summary>
