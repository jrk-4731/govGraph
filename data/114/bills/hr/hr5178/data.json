The VA may disapprove any course of education offered by a covered educational institution that does not ensure that an SCO meets such requirements. (A covered educational institution is an institution that has enrolled 20 or more individuals using veterans educational assistance.)\n\n(Sec. 7) A reporting fee paid by the VA to an educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee after the date of enactment of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2011 with respect to an institution that has 75 or more enrollees may not be used for or merged with amounts available for the general fund of the educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee.\n\n(Sec. 8) The VA Inspector General shall apply heightened scrutiny to any education program if any federal or state agency has made a final judgment or settlement that the program used deceptive or misleading practices that are potentially in violation of advertising, sales, and enrollment practices.\n\n The VA shall: (1) provide notice of, and the reasons for, such heightened scrutiny to an individual who is enrolled in an approved course and entitled to educational assistance; and (2) advise such individual to request a transcript and seek counseling about transferring any credits earned.\n\n The VA shall: (1) monitor allegations of deceptive and misleading practices made against educational programs; and (2) include information about any such allegation on the GI Bill Comparison Tool or any similar VA website.\n\n(Sec. 9) The VA shall: (1) disapprove a course of education provided by an institution of higher learning if the VA determines, pursuant to such heightened scrutiny, that the institution has engaged in deceptive or misleading practices; and (2) provide transfer counseling services to individuals enrolled in a disapproved course."
