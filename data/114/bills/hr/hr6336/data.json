A grant may not exceed 50% of the development cost of the project. USDA may increase the limit to 75% for projects that serve a remote or low-income area that does not have access to broadband service from any provider.\n\nThe bill sets forth reporting requirements for recipients of the grants, loans, or loan guarantees."
