Requires a revision to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require a certification from each person that is a prospective government contractor that such person, and any person owned or controlled by such person, is not a boycotting person (a person who, with the intent to comply with or support a boycott against Israel, refuses to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with a business concern organized under Israeli law). Debars from eligibility for federal contracts for at least two years any person who submits a false certification.</summary>
