This bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make grants to low-income families to assist them in obtaining residences that are visitable for individuals.

A residence shall be "visitable" if it complies with the most current version of the visitability standards of the International Code Council/American National Standards Institute.

Amounts from such grants may be used only for:

 acquiring a visitable residence that has never previously been occupied, constructing a visitable residence, and retrofitting or renovating an existing residence to make it visitable.</summary>
