  <summary date="2015-04-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 2015

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish and implement a hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, a genetic vascular bleeding disorder that causes abnormalities of the blood vessels) initiative to improve early detection, screening, and treatment of people who suffer from HHT, focusing on advancing HHT research and increasing physician and public awareness of HHT.

Directs HHS to establish the HHT Coordinating Committee to develop and coordinate implementation of a plan to advance research and understanding of HHT, including by conducting or supporting research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and making recommendations regarding NIH research grants relating to HHT.

Requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to carry out activities with respect to HHT, including conducting surveillance and establishing an HHT resource center to provide comprehensive education on and disseminate information about HHT to health professionals, patients, industry, and the public.

Requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to award grants for HHT research, including an analysis of health care expenditures associated with untreated HHT and costs associated with preventable medical events among Medicare beneficiaries with HHT.</summary>
