(Sec. 1) This bill makes permanent the requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out, through the Readjustment Counseling Service of the Veterans Health Administration, a program to provide reintegration and readjustment services in group retreat settings to women veterans who are recently separated from service after a prolonged deployment. (Currently, such program is required as a pilot program under the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.)

 Such services shall include:

 information on family, employment, and community reintegration; financial and occupational counseling; and information and counseling on stress reduction and conflict resolution.</summary>
