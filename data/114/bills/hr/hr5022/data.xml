This bill amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to include assistance to dislocated workers through increased outreach about small business opportunities and consultation about starting a small business among the rapid response activities to assist such workers in obtaining reemployment which a state, or state-designated entity, provides in the event of a permanent closure or mass layoff at a plant, facility, or enterprise, or a natural or other disaster, resulting in mass job dislocation.

A state may in such an event allocate up to 10% of funds reserved by the state governor for statewide rapid response activities to provide outreach about small business opportunities and consultation about starting a small business.</summary>
