This bill expands the categories of reportable crime statistics to also include criminal offenses in which a firearm was present at the scene of the crime.\n\nAdditionally, it requires an IHE to include, in its annual security report provided to students and employees, a statement of its current policy on concealed carry or open carry of firearms.\n\nAn IHE must also disclose that policy on its website and in promotional materials."
