A nonviolent criminal offense is a federal misdemeanor or felony offense that: (1) does not include, as an element, the use of a weapon or violence; and (2) does not involve violence in its commission.\n\nTo be eligible for expungement, an individual must: be a first-time offender; avoid drug or alcohol dependency or abuse; obtain a high school diploma; complete one year of community service; and fulfill the requirements of a court-ordered sentence, such as complete a prison term, meet the conditions of supervised release, and pay fines."
