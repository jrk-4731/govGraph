  <summary date="2015-07-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Rebuilding Urban Inner Cities Is Long Overdue Act of 2015 or the REBUILD Act 

Provides FY2015 supplemental appropriations for the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Designates each amount provided by this bill as an emergency requirement, pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Provides that the funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the amounts. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)

Provides appropriations to DOJ for: the Office of Justice Programs, including State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance and Juvenile Justice Programs; and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS).

Provides appropriations to the SBA for Entrepreneurial Development Programs and the Business Loans Program Account.

Provides appropriations to Labor for the Employment and Training Administration.

Provides appropriations to HHS for the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Provides appropriations to HUD for Public and Indian Housing, Community Planning and Development, and the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.

Requires HUD to extend current Moving to Work agreements of previously designated participating agencies until the end of FY2028, subject to specified requirements and restrictions. (Moving to Work is a demonstration program that provides HUD and local Public Housing Authorities flexibility to test alternative policies for providing housing assistance through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and the public housing program.)</summary>
