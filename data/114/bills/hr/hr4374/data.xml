This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to award grants to institutions of higher education to provide and improve mental and behavioral health services, conduct research regarding improving the mental health of students, and expand outreach and training on college and university campuses.

SAMHSA must give special consideration to programs that: (1) demonstrate the greatest need, (2) propose effective approaches for initiating or expanding campus services, (3) target underserved and at-risk populations, (4) coordinate with a community mental health center or other community mental health resources, (5) identify how the college or university will address psychiatric emergencies, (6) propose innovative practices to improve care or prevention programs, and (7) demonstrate the greatest potential for replication and dissemination.

SAMHSA must convene an interagency, public-private sector working group to plan, establish, and begin coordinating and evaluating a targeted public education campaign that is designed to focus on mental and behavioral health on college and university campuses.

The Department of Health and Human Services must establish the College Campus Task Force to discuss mental and behavioral health concerns on college and university campuses.</summary>
