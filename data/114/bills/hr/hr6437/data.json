The President shall submit such a report in the case of an introduction of the Armed Forces by reason of a national emergency within 48 hours of, and again not later than 60 days after, such introduction.\n\nThe War Powers Resolution and specified other prior authorizations for the use of the Armed Forces are repealed."
