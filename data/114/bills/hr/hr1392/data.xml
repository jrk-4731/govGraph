  <summary date="2015-03-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fighting Occupied Cell Use So Everyone Drives More Safely Act of 2015 or the FOCUS Act of 2015

This bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to withhold 25% of a state's apportionment of certain federal-aid highway funds for a fiscal year if the state has not enacted and is not enforcing a law that:

 prohibits an operator of a moving motor vehicle from using a communication device, except in the event of an emergency, if the operator is under age 21, and using a hand-held communication device if that operator is 21 or older; and requires, upon conviction of a violation of such prohibition, the imposition of penalties similar to those for conviction of the offense of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence. "Communication device" means a mobile telephone or other portable electronic communication device with which a user engages in a call or writes, sends, or reads a message, or plays a game or watches a video.</summary>
