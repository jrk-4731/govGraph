This bill states that it is U.S. policy to expect the Cuban government to extradite all known U.S. fugitives back to the United States.

No federal funds may be used to accept commercial flight plans for travel between the United States and Cuba until Cuba extradites to the United States the last known fugitive from justice from the United States who is in Cuba.</summary>
