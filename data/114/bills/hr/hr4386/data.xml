This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify provisions related to the Federal Pell Grant program. Among other things, it:

 increases the maximum Pell Grant award for academic year 2017-2018 and adjusts it in subsequent award years to account for inflation, converts the Pell Grant program into a mandatory spending program, increases from 12 to 15 semesters a student's lifetime Pell Grant eligibility period, and restores year-round grants. Additionally, the bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to include, as a qualified scholarship excludible from gross income, any amount received as a Pell Grant.</summary>
