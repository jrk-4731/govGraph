This bill amends the Natural Gas Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), before granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a proposed pipeline expansion project, to:

 conduct a full evidentiary hearing on the need for the expansion or a cumulative review of planned energy infrastructure projects in the region of the proposed expansion; and consider matters that include existing capacity, renewable energy goals, and the ability to otherwise meet energy needs. Additionally, FERC must: (1) consider, in the case of interstate pipeline projects, the cumulative environmental impacts of other interstate or regional projects; and (2) monitor approved pipeline projects for five years to ensure that environmental mitigation steps have been implemented.</summary>
