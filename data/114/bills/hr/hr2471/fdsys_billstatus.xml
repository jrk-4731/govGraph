          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Maximizing America's Prosperity Act of 2015 </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to limit total noninterest federal spending to a specified percentage of potential gross domestic product (GDP). </p> <p>The cap begins at 19% of potential GDP for FY2016 and decreases each fiscal year until it reaches 16% of potential GDP for FY2024 and subsequent fiscal years. The total cap for each year fiscal year must be reduced by an amount equal to the unfunded direct costs of federal mandates for the year. </p> <p>The bill revises the existing sequestration process to establish a new process to enforce the limits established by this bill. To enforce the caps, the bill's sequestration process would impose automatic cuts to discretionary spending. No discretionary budget account is permitted to be reduced by more than 5% of its budgetary resources. </p> <p>The bill eliminates adjustments to spending limits that are currently permitted for emergency spending. The President's budget must include an allowance for emergency spending that is no less than 1% of discretionary spending for the year. The appropriations committees must set aside for emergencies 1% of the funding allocation provided to the committees by the budget resolution. </p>]]></text>
