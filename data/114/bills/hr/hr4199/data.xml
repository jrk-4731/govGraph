This bill establishes the Puerto Rico Financial Stability Council, subject to enactment of a law by the Legislative Assembly and the governor of Puerto Rico.

For each fiscal year the governor of Puerto Rico shall develop a financial plan, and the Legislative Assembly shall develop a budget, that meet specified requirements to promote financial stability, and both shall submit them to the Council for its approval. The bill prescribes procedures for submission to the Council of revised financial plans or revised budgets in the event of disapproval for failing meet specified criteria.

The government of Puerto Rico may not borrow money unless the Council certifies in advance that both the receipt of borrowed funds and the repayment of obligations incurred are consistent with the financial plan and budget for the year.

The bill also prescribes procedures for addressing any variance of actual revenues and expenditures from the adopted financial plan and budget, including the withholding of funds under federal programs.

The Council shall recommend to the governor, the Legislative Assembly, the President, and Congress actions for the government of Puerto Rico or the federal government to take to ensure compliance with a financial plan and budget.

The bill amends federal bankruptcy law to apply to Puerto Rico treatment as a state with respect to Adjustments of Debts of a Municipality.</summary>
