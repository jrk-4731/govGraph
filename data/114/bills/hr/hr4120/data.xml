This bill amends the Head Start Act to replace the existing Head Start program with block grants to states and Indian tribes for prekindergarten (pre-K) education.

Instead of providing direct financial assistance to Head Start agencies, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall allot block grant funds for pre-K education among eligible states and Indian tribes in accordance with&#160;their relative proportions of children, age five and younger, from low-income households.&#160;Grant recipients&#160;shall use the grant funds to: (1)&#160;award subgrants to eligible entities&#160;that provide&#160;pre-K education programs; (2) administer such programs; and (3) provide technical assistance, oversight, monitoring, research, and training.

Under current law, HHS is authorized to designate, monitor, and establish standards for&#160;Head Start agencies. The bill instead shifts&#160;pre-K program oversight and control&#160;to states and Indian tribes, which&#160;shall have full flexibility to use grant funds to finance the pre-K programs of&#160;their choice.&#160;In addition,&#160;grant recipients may use grant funds to establish portable voucher systems that allow costs to be paid&#160;for attendance at&#160;private pre-K education programs.

Under current law, federal financial assistance for a Head Start program&#160;is generally limited to&#160;80% of total program costs. The bill maintains this&#160;limitation by&#160;requiring grant recipients to provide matching funds equal to 20% of the grant amount.</summary>
