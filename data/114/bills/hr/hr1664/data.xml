  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Health Insurance Freedom Act of 2015

Permits a health insurance issuer that had in effect health insurance coverage in the group or individual market on any date during 2013 to continue offering that coverage outside of a health care exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Treats that coverage as a grandfathered health plan for purposes of an individual meeting the requirement to maintain minimum essential health coverage.

Applies only to coverage in states where the state insurance commissioner elects to apply these provisions.</summary>
