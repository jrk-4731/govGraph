This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize a state to refuse without penalty to expend refugee resettlement assistance with respect to an alien who:

 is a national of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism or a terrorist sanctuary, or has no nationality and the country in which the alien last habitually resided is a state sponsor of terrorism or a terrorist sanctuary. A state may not refuse to expend such funds with respect to an alien who is an Iraqi national (or spouse or children of one) who was employed by, or worked for the U.S. government in Iraq and has or is experiencing an ongoing serious threat because of such employment.</summary>
