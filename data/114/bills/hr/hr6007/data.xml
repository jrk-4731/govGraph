(Sec. 1) This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT), if it decides that constructing or altering a structure may result in interference with space navigation facilities and equipment, to study the extent of any adverse impact that may result on the safe and efficient use of airspace, facilities, or equipment.

In conducting such a study, DOT shall consider the impact on launch and reentry for launch and reentry vehicles arriving or departing from a launch site or reentry site.</summary>
