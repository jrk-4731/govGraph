This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure that research on child restraint devices for use during critical phases of flight on commercial passenger aircraft encourages the assessment and development of new and innovative technologies and devices that improve safety for children, parents, and other passengers.

The FAA shall require the Civil Aeromedical Institute to initiate a research program focused on improving the safety of such devices and report to Congress on the results, including recommended changes to federal laws and regulations to allow additional devices to be used to keep children, their parents, and other passengers safe.</summary>
