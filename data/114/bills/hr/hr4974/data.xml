This bill provides FY2017 appropriations to the Department of Defense (DOD) for military construction, military family housing, the U.S. share of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program, and base closures and realignments.

The bill also provides appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for veterans benefit and health care programs, Departmental Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration.

Related agencies and programs funded in the bill include the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims; the Armed Forces Retirement Home; and the Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery.

The bill includes Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and Defense-Wide military construction funds which are designated as Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds and are not subject to discretionary spending limits.

The bill includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. It increases discretionary and overall FY2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding above FY2016 levels. Compared to FY2016 levels, the bill increases discretionary funding for the VA and decreases discretionary funding for the DOD Military Construction and Family Housing accounts.

The bill permits unobligated balances of funds previously provided for the Ebola outbreak to be used to prevent, prepare, and respond to the Zika virus.

It also includes provisions that:

 prohibit the Administration from renovating, expanding, or constructing facilities in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay; restrict the display of Confederate flags in VA cemeteries; permit VA providers to complete forms for a veteran's participation in a state marijuana program, and prohibit the use of funds for a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.
