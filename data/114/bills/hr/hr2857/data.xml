  <summary date="2016-03-22T09:43:42Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 10, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

(Sec. 1) This bill revises a condition for establishment of the Coltsville National Historical Park in Connecticut to require the state, the city, or the private property owner, as appropriate, to enter into a written agreement with the Department of the Interior to donate at least 10,000 square feet of space in the Colt Armory Complex (currently, the East Armory).

No non-federal property may be included in the Historical Park without the owner's written consent.

The establishment of the Historical Park or its management shall not be construed to create buffer zones outside of it.</summary>
