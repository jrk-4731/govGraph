  <summary date="2015-09-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Gestational Diabetes Act of 2015 or the GEDI Act

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a multisite gestational diabetes research project within the diabetes program of the CDC to expand and enhance surveillance data and public health research on gestational diabetes.&#160;

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must expand and intensify public health research on gestational diabetes, including; (1) developing and testing novel approaches for improving postpartum testing or screening and for preventing type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes, and (2) conducting research to&#160;further understanding of the&#160;factors and health systems that influence the risk&#160;of gestational diabetes and the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes.

The CDC must: (1) award grants for demonstration projects to reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, the recurrence of such disease in subsequent pregnancies, and the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes; and (2) work with state and Indian tribal-based diabetes prevention and control programs assisted by the CDC to encourage postpartum follow-up after gestational diabetes to reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes and its recurrence, the development of type 2 diabetes in at-risk women, and&#160;related complications.</summary>
