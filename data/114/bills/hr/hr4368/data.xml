  <summary date="2016-01-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) to specify how a state must treat&#160;qualified lottery winnings and lump sum income for purposes of determining an individual's income-based eligibility for a state Medicaid program. Specifically, a state shall include such winnings or income as income received: (1) in the month in which it was received, if the amount is less than $60,000; (2) over a period of two months, if the amount is at least $60,000 but less than $70,000; (3) over a period of three months, if the amount is at least $70,000 but less than $80,000; and (4) over an additional one-month period for each increment of $10,000 received, not to exceed 120 months.

Qualified lump sum income includes: (1) monetary winnings from gambling; (2) damages&#160;received&#160;in lump sums or periodic payments,&#160;excluding monthly payments, on account of causes of action other than those arising from personal physical injuries or sickness; and (3) income received as liquid assets from the estate of a deceased individual.</summary>
