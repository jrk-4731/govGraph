  <summary date="2016-11-14T14:51:55Z" status="Reported to House with amendment(s)">(Sec. 1) This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to acquire the structure known as "Lunette Blair," which is related to the Fort Scott National Historic Site in Fort Scott, Bourbon County, Kansas.

The boundary of the Fort Scott National Historic Site in Kansas is modified as depicted on the map referred to as "Fort Scott National Historic Site Proposed Boundary Modification," and dated February 2016. Interior may acquire by donation or exchange only lands and interests in land within the boundaries of the site. Interior may not acquire any such lands or interests in land by condemnation. No private property or nonfederal property shall be included within the site without the written consent of the owner of that property. Nothing in this bill, the establishment of the site, nor the management plan for the site, shall be construed as creating a buffer zone outside of the site.</summary>
