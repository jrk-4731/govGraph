Highlights: 

The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 provides annual appropriations for:

 the Department of Labor; most of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Department of Education (ED); and several related agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the National Labor Relations Board. The bill does not include funding for the Food and Drug Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which are included within HHS, but considered in other appropriations bills.

The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The majority of the funding in the bill is mandatory funding for entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income that are funded in annual appropriations bills. These programs, known as appropriated entitlements, are included in annual appropriations bills, though the amounts provided for the programs are generally determined by authorizing statutes that control details of the programs such as eligibility rules and benefit levels.

The bill decreases discretionary funding compared to FY2015 levels. It also includes provisions that restrict funding or affect polices in areas such as:

 implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, abortion, human embryo research, collective bargaining, fiduciary standards for providing investment advice for pension and retirement plans, needle exchange programs, and dietary guidelines. The bill terminates the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and transfers certain functions to other HHS agencies.

The bill also restricts funding for Department of Education regulations to develop a college ratings system, define gainful employment, establish requirements for the state authorization of higher education programs, define credit hours, and establish a teacher preparation program accountability system.
