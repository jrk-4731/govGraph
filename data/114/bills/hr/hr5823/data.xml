This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to prohibit the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from providing any financial or other assistance or advice to, or otherwise engaging with, organizations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood or any individual or other person determined by DHS to be associated with it.
