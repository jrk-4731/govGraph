  <summary date="2016-09-22T13:06:37Z" status="Passed House amended">(Sec. 1) This bill amends the San Luis Rey Indian Water Rights Settlement Act to approve and ratify the settlement agreement dated January 30, 2015, and approved by the La Jolla, Rincon, San Pasqual, Pauma, and Pala Bands of Mission Indians (California), the San Luis Rey River Indian Water Authority, the City of Escondido, California, the Vista Irrigation District, and the United States.

The Departments of the Interior and Justice may execute the agreement and any amendments approved by the parties to make it consistent with such Act. Such execution shall not constitute a major federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Interior is authorized to take steps necessary to implement the agreement and such Act.

The tribes will continue to possess federally reserved rights and other water rights held in trust by the United States. In any proceeding involving the assertion, enforcement, or defense of such rights, the United States shall not be a required party and and any decision by the United States regarding participation in any such proceeding shall not be subject to judicial review or give rise to any claim for relief against the United States.

Congress confirms that the benefits to allottees in the agreement are equitable and fully satisfy their water rights.

(Sec. 2) A limit is set on the amount that may be allocated annually from the San Luis Rey Tribal Development Fund.</summary>
