 Prohibits any federal department, agency, or federal government contractor from making a monetary payment to any official of a foreign country for the purposes of bribery, coercion, or any illegal activity that undermines the rule of law or corrupts a public official. Requires the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to report to Congress on all monetary payments made by the CIA to officials of the Government of Afghanistan on or after September 11, 2001. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this Act if compliance would harm U.S. national security or members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
