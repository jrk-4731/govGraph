This bill increases the statutory debt limit by $1 trillion after Congress adopts a balanced budget Constitutional amendment and by an additional $1 trillion after the amendment is ratified by the states.

To comply with the requirements of this bill, the amendment must:

 prohibit total outlays for a year from exceeding receipts, excluding receipts derived from borrowing and outlays for repayment of debt principal; permit the deficit prohibition to be suspended by a majority of both houses of Congress in any year in which the United States is actively engaged in military conflict pursuant to a war declared by Congress or by a fourth-fifths vote in any other year; require the President to ensure that total outlays for a fiscal year do not exceed receipts and consider the failure to prevent a deficit to be an impeachable offense; permit any Member of Congress, governor, or attorney general to have standing and a cause of action to seek judicial enforcement of the amendment; prohibit the President, a court, or any state from ordering a tax increase or other revenue measures to enforce the requirements; and phase-in the requirements using a specified schedule of declining deficits.</summary>
