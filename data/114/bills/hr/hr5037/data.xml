District of Columbia Courts and Public Defender Service Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the District of Columbia Code to authorize the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration to establish a voluntary separation incentive payments program for nonjudicial employees of the District courts substantially similar to that for certain federal employees and members of the uniformed services, except that the maximum payment amount to any individual may not exceed $25,000.

(Sec. 3) The District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 is amended to authorize the District of Columbia Public Defender Service also to establish such a program for the Service's employees, again limiting the maximum payment amount to any individual to $25,000.</summary>
