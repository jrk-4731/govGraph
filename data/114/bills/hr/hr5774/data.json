The bill allows these recipients of additional SBA disaster assistance resulting from a declared major disaster to use CDBG-DR grant funds only if they are used for such repayments.\n\nThe term Superstorm Sandy CDBG-DR grant funds means mandatory amounts made available by the Department of Housing and Urban Development only for impacted and distressed areas resulting from a declared major disaster due to Superstorm Sandy for activities authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.\n\nA small business concern, homeowner, or nonprofit entity who receives assistance pursuant to any other law to repair, rehabilitate, or replace real property damaged or destroyed by or as a result of a declared major disaster on or after enactment of this bill may use such assistance to repay the principal and any interest accrued on a loan or the amount of other assistance received under it."
