This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support programs that provide for the continued operation of the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative (NCTSI) and for research on evidence-based practices for identifying and treating children and youth with mental, behavioral, and biological disorders resulting from witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event.

HHS must award a cooperative agreement to a comprehensive national coordinating center to oversee NCTSI activities.

The NCTSI coordinating center must: (1) collect, analyze, and report data to establish the effectiveness of early identification and delivery of treatment and services; (2) focus on the development of services and resources to prevent the long-term consequences of child trauma; (3) collaborate with federal research institutions; and (4) collaborate with HHS in the dissemination of evidence-based and trauma-informed interventions, treatments, products, and other resources.</summary>
