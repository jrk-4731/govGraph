This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to declare that the following persons may be naturalized upon compliance with all naturalization requirements, except that no prior residence or specified physical presence within the United States shall be required:

 a person who is the surviving spouse, child, or parent of a U.S. citizen who died as a result of injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by employment as a first responder; and in the case of such a surviving spouse, the person was living in marital union with the citizen spouse at the time of the citizen spouse's death. The Department of Homeland Security shall provide for the granting of posthumous citizenship at the time of death to a person who, while an alien or a noncitizen national of the United States, died as a result of injury or disease incurred or aggravated while serving as a first responder.</summary>
