The office must be headed by a director who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIt authorizes the Office of Elder Justice to award grants to states to develop, establish, and operate programs to improve the response to, investigation of, and prosecution of elder abuse cases. An eligible state must have a compensation program for crime victims and a multidisciplinary task force on elder justice.\n\nDOJ must identify, collect, and publish data related to the incidence of elder abuse. It must also develop recommendations for collecting additional data related to elder abuse.\n\nFinally, the bill amends the Social Security Act to include the director of the Office of Elder Justice as the alternate for the Attorney General on the Elder Justice Coordinating Council."
