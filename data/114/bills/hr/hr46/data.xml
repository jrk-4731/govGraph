  <summary date="2015-01-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No More Tulias: Drug Law Enforcement Evidentiary Standards Improvement Act of 2015

This bill prohibits a state from receiving for a fiscal year any drug control and system improvement (Byrne) grant funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, or any amount from any other federal law enforcement assistance program, unless the state does not fund any antidrug task forces for that fiscal year or it has in effect laws that ensure that: (1) a person is not convicted of a drug offense unless the fact that a drug offense was committed and the person's commission of the offense are supported by evidence other than the eyewitness testimony of a law enforcement officer or those acting on an officer's behalf, and (2) an officer may participate in an antidrug task force only if that officer's honesty and integrity are evaluated and found to be at an appropriately high level.

 States receiving federal funds under this bill are directed to collect data on the racial distribution of drug charges, the nature of the criminal law specified in the charges, and the jurisdictions in which such charges are made.</summary>
