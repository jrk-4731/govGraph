This bill amends the rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives to prohibit a recess or adjournment longer than 24 hours until Congress agrees to a budget resolution that establishes a balanced budget no later than FY2026.

The bill also amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to create points of order against resolutions providing for: (1) the adjournment of the House for more than three days during August until the House has approved all of the annual appropriation bills, or (2) the adjournment of either the House or the Senate for more than three days between October 1 and the duration of the session of Congress until all of the annual appropriation bills have been presented to the President.</summary>
