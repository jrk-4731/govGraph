Prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from applying the rule entitled "National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program: Nutrition Standards for All Foods Sold in School as Required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010" to food sold as a fundraiser that takes place on the grounds of a school, including by limiting the number of such fundraisers by state agencies or the Secretary. (The rule requires the Secretary to set nutrition standards for all foods sold in schools that are not foods sold under the school lunch and breakfast programs.)</summary>
