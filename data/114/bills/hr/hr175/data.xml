This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Environmental Protection Agency to revise the Energy Star program to exempt program partners that have complied with all program requirements for a period of at least 18 months from third-party certification requirements for the labeling of consumer, home, and office electronic products. In order to facilitate product listing and performance verification for a sample of products, the EPA may require test data and other product information to be submitted.

The exemption from third-party certification provided to a program partner will be terminated if the partner is found to have violated program requirements with respect to at least two separate models during a two-year period. The exemption will resume if the partner complies with all program requirements for at least three years.</summary>
