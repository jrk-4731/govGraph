This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to deny Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)credits to any automobile manufacturer that circumvents emission control requirements to obtain CAFE credits unlawfully. Manufacturers earn CAFE credits when the average fuel economy for a given annualfleet of vehicles exceeds the minimalrequiredCAFE standards.

Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA)is authorized to collect additional penalties from manufacturers that obtain CAFE credits unlawfully.

The bill also establishes an Air Quality RestorationTrust Fund funded with deposits from penalties NHTSA collects from manufacturers under this bill. The fund must be used solely forproviding grants to support specific programs that restore and improve air quality.</summary>
