This bill amends the Small Business Act with respect to guarantee fees for small business loans.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) shall have discretion not to collect a guarantee fee for a loan repayable in one year or less.

The SBA may not, however, collect a guarantee fee in connection with a loan repayable in one year or less if it is made to a borrower that resides in a county with an annual unemployment rate for the preceding calendar year of at least one percentage point greater than the national annual unemployment rate for that year.</summary>
