  <summary date="2015-12-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Primary Care Physician Reentry Act of 2015

 This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a demonstration program to facilitate physician reentry into primary care clinical practice. To be eligible to participate, a physician must agree to provide primary care at a health center for at least two years.

Grantees must assist reentering physicians by providing training, paying credentialing and other necessary fees, paying salaries, and providing loan repayment and other financial assistance.

HHS must: (1) assess the need for additional primary care physicians, (2) develop a directory of programs that help physicians reenter clinical practice, (3) disseminate evaluation tools to measure the core competencies of physicians reentering clinical practice, and (4) assist regulatory and credentialing authorities to structure requirements for reentering physicians that ensure patient safety while addressing the burdens on those physicians.

 This bill limits civil liability for physicians participating in a reentry project.</summary>
