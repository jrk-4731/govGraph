  <summary date="2016-04-13T13:58:10Z" status="Passed House amended">State and High-Risk Urban Area Working Group Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require any state or high-risk urban area receiving a grant under the State Homeland Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security Initiative to establish an urban area working group to assist in preparation and revision of the state, regional, or local homeland security plan or the threat and hazard identification and risk assessment.

The bill adds to the stakeholders who shall have at least one representative on such a committee or working group:

 public health officials and other appropriate medical practitioners, individuals representing educational institutions, state and regional interoperable communications coordinators, and state and major urban area fusion centers. (A fusion center serves as a focal point within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners.)</summary>
