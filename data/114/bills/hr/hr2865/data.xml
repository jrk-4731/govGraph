This bill amends the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 with respect to rollovers to a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) of payments to qualified airline employees in commercial airline carrier bankruptcy cases.

A commercial airline employee shall be qualified for such a rollover if he or she had participated in a commercial airline's tax-exempt defined benefit pension plan that was terminated or otherwise restricted.

 The bill prescribes a special rule for airline payments received by a qualified employee from an airline carrier resulting from a bankruptcy case filed after September 11, 2001, and before January 1, 2007, or on November 29, 2011.

Under this special rule, the period for a qualified airline employee to make a tax-exempt rollover of such a payment into a traditional IRA shall be extended to the period beginning on December 18, 2014, and ending 180 days after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
