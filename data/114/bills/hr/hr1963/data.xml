  <summary date="2015-04-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Federal Leadership in Energy Efficient Transportation Act of 2015 or the FLEET Act of 2015&#160;

Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to expand the definition of "energy or water conservation measure" under such Act to include, in the case of a contract in which the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is a party: (1) the purchase or lease of low emission and fuel efficient vehicles; (2) the upgrade of USPS vehicles to increase average fuel economy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions; or (3) the construction or&#160;maintenance&#160;of infrastructure to support such vehicles, including electric vehicle charging stations. Expands the program of agency incentives for conserving energy to include in utility incentive programs measures to support the use of low emission and fuel efficient USPS vehicles.

Prohibits USPS from awarding a contract for a vehicle, or purchasing or leasing a vehicle for use by USPS, including a passenger car, light truck, or medium or heavy-duty vehicle, unless the vehicle meets certain minimum carbon dioxide emissions standards and average fuel economy standards.

Prohibits USPS from meeting the requirements of this Act by: (1) reducing the frequency of mail delivery, (2) closing post offices or postal distribution facilities, (3) taking any action to restrict or diminish a collective bargaining agreement or eliminate or reduce employee benefits, or (4) entering into a contact with a private company to perform duties that are currently performed by postal employees who are bargaining unit employees.</summary>
