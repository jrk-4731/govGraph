Requires state or local courts that do not have magnetometers available for use to use grant matching funds to acquire magnetometers.\n\nDirects the General Services Administration to ensure that state or local courthouses having less security equipment than such courthouses require have an opportunity to request surplus security equipment (metal detectors, wands, baggage screening devices) before such equipment is made available to any other individual or entity. Requires that priority be given to courthouses that have no security equipment."
