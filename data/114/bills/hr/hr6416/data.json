    "text": "Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 TITLE I--DISABILITY COMPENSATION MATTERS (Sec. 101) This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to pay burial and funeral expenses, accrued benefits, dependency and indemnity compensation, and non-service connected disability or death pension amounts to a survivor of a veteran who has not filed a formal claim if the record contains sufficient evidence to establish the survivor's entitlement to such benefits. The date of receipt of an application for such benefits shall be the earlier of: (1) the date on which the survivor notifies the VA of the veteran's death through a death certificate (or other relevant medical evidence establishing the survivor's entitlement) indicating that the death was due to a service-connected or compensable disability or (2) the date on which any other federal agency notifies the VA of the veteran's death. The VA shall report to Congress on benefits paid pursuant to covered claims. (Sec. 102) The Board of Veterans' Appeals shall, for purposes of scheduling a veteran's appeal hearing at the earliest possible date, determine whether to provide such hearing: (1) at its principal location or at another VA or federal facility within the regional VA's area, and (2) through the use of video conferencing or by an appellant's personal appearance. The board shall notify the appellant of such decisions. Upon notification, the appellant may request a different location or type of hearing, and the board shall grant such request while ensuring that the hearing is scheduled at the earliest possible date. (Sec. 103) The VA shall: (1) make available to the public the average length of time to adjudicate an early-filed appeal and a later-filed appeal, and (2) report to congress on whether such publication has had an effect on the number of appeals filed early. (Sec. 104) The Government Accountability Office shall: (1) complete a review of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) regional offices to help the VBA achieve more consistent performance in processing disability compensation claims, and (2) submit a related report to Congress. (Sec. 105) The VA shall report to Congress on the criteria and procedures to be used to determine appropriate staffing levels at regional VA offices under the National Work Queue for the distribution of the claims processing workload. (Sec. 106) The President shall include in his annual budget submission to Congress information on the VBA's capacity to process benefits claims. (Sec. 107) The VA shall report to Congress on plans to reduce the work item inventory listed in certain Monday Morning Workload Reports. (Sec. 108) The VA shall submit to Congress three annual reports on the VA's progress in implementing the veterans benefits management system. (Sec. 109) Licensed, VA-contracted physicians may conduct VA-authorized medical disability examinations at any location in any state, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. commonwealth, territory, or possession, so long as the examination is authorized under the contract. The bill provides similar provisions for the pilot program authorized under the the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996. (Sec. 110) The VA shall: (1) enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine or an appropriate independent organization for an assessment of VA examinations furnished to individuals seeking disability compensation for traumatic brain injuries, and (2) submit a related report to Congress. (Sec. 111) The VA shall report to Congress: (1) regarding VA policies with respect to processing reasonably raised unrelated claims, and (2) annually for five years regarding complete and incomplete claims for VA disability compensation. TITLE II--UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS (Sec. 201) The bill: (1) extends the temporary expansion of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims until January 1, 2021, and (2) requires the chief judge to report to Congress on such temporary expansions by June 30, 2020. (Sec. 202) A regular active service judge or a retired judge shall be treated as an employee for government life insurance purposes. The court may pay for judges age 65 and older any increase in the cost of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance imposed after April 24, 1999. (Sec. 203) Regular service judges, retired recall-eligible judges, and certain retired but not recall-eligible judges may purchase in three-month increments up to an additional year of service credit for each year of federal judicial service completed. (Sec. 204) The bill modifies provisions regarding the chief judge, including by requiring the chief judge to have at least three years remaining as a court judge in regular active service. Such changes shall apply on or after January 20, 2020. TITLE III--BURIAL BENEFITS AND OTHER MATTERS (Sec. 301) The VA may, in lieu of furnishing a headstone or marker to a deceased individual, furnish a medallion or other device to signify the deceased individual's veteran status, to be attached to a headstone or marker furnished at private expense. For the purposes of such provision a \"deceased individual\" is an individual who: (1) served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917; and (2) is eligible for a headstone or marker or who would be eligible but for his or her date of death. The VA shall furnish at a private cemetery, upon request, a headstone, marker, or medallion that signifies the status of an eligible veteran who served in the Armed Forces on or after April 6, 1917, as a Medal of Honor recipient. If the VA furnished a headstone, marker, or medallion for a deceased veteran that does not signify his or her status as a Medal of Honor recipient, the VA shall, upon request, replace that headstone, marker, or medallion with one that signifies the deceased's status as a Medal of Honor recipient. (Sec. 302) The bill authorizes award of the Presidential Memorial Certificate to certain deceased members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, the Air or Army National Guard, and the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. (Sec. 303) The VA shall report to Congress regarding the interring of veterans' unclaimed remains in national cemeteries under the control of the National Cemetery Administration. (Sec. 304) The VA shall conduct a study on the feasibility and the need for Saturday and Sunday interments in veterans cemeteries. (Sec. 305) Any person entitled to retired pay for non-regular (reserve) service, or who but for age would be so entitled, shall be honored as a veteran but not be entitled to any benefit by reason of such recognition. TITLE IV--EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION (Sec. 401) Any member of the Armed Forces who died between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2005, is deemed to have died on January 1, 2006, in order to make that member's surviving spouse eligible for the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry scholarship. (Under current law, surviving spouses of service members who die in the line of duty after September 11, 2001, are eligible for such assistance until the earlier of the date they remarry or the date that is 15 years after the military spouse's death.) A surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces who died between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2005, who elected before enactment of this bill to receive educational benefits under the Survivors and Dependents Educational Assistance program or the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry program may revoke such choice. (Such an election is currently irrevocable.) (Sec. 402) A veteran may pursue a course of education and training as part of a rehabilitation program only if the course is approved according to VA vocational rehabilitation requirements. (Sec. 403) The VA may prioritize vocational rehabilitation services based on need and upon consideration of disability ratings, the severity of employment handicaps, qualification for a program of independent living, income, and other appropriate factors. (Sec. 404) An educational institution that received a payment on behalf of an individual entitled to Post-9/11 educational assistance shall submit to the VA information regarding such individual's academic progress. (Sec. 405) Individuals may elect to convert their educational assistance to the Post-9/11 veterans' educational assistance program if, as of August 1, 2009, they met specified conditions with respect to their entitlements and elections under the all-volunteer force educational assistance program or certain other educational programs for professional military, selected reserve, or reserve component members. Post-9/11 program eligibility shall be conditioned on an individual's meeting program requirements as of the date of election. The bill prescribes transitional rules with respect to the transfer or revocation of entitlements from a previous assistance program after an election to convert to the Post-9/11 program. Certain assistance shall remain available to individuals under their previous program if it is not available under the Post-9/11 program. After January 1, 2017, if an individual submits an election that the VA determines is against the individual's interests, the VA may make an alternative election on the individual's behalf. Such an individual may, during a specified period, modify or revoke the VA's alternative selection. (Sec. 406) The period for certain qualifying work-study activities for individuals receiving VA educational assistance is extended through June 30, 2022. (Sec. 407) The bill permits centralized reporting of veterans enrollment by a group, district, or consortium of separately accredited educational institutions located in the same state. (Sec. 408) Specified education programs are deemed to be approved for veterans' education benefit purposes if a state approving agency determines that they qualify. A state approving agency, or the VA acting in the role of a state approving agency, may approve other accredited programs for such purposes. (Sec. 409) The bill revises licensure or certification program requirements necessary for VA approval. (Sec. 410) State approving agencies may continue to establish additional criteria for the approval of nonaccredited courses, but the VA must, in consultation with the state approving agency, determine that such criteria are necessary and treat public, private, and proprietary for-profit educational institutions equitably. (Sec. 411) The VA shall conduct an annual compliance survey of educational institutions and training establishments offering one or more courses approved for the enrollment of eligible veterans or persons if at least 20 such veterans or persons are enrolled in any such course. (Currently, an annual compliance survey of each institution offering such courses must be conducted if at least 300 beneficiaries are enrolled or if any such course does not lead to a standard college degree.) Each educational institution and training establishment shall be surveyed at lease once every two years. (Sec. 412) The rates of the reporting fees that are paid to educational institutions for each educational assistance beneficiary are revised for the periods ending: (1) September 25, 2017, and (2) September 25, 2026. (Sec. 413) The bill revises the requirements of the composition of the Veterans Advisory Committee on Education. (Sec. 414) The VA shall contract with a non-government entity for a survey of individuals who have used or are using their educational assistance to pursue a program of education or training. (Sec. 415) VA counselors who provide specified educational or vocational counseling services shall provide a requesting veteran or member of the Armed Forces with information about the articulation agreements (agreements governing the transferability of credits toward meeting specific degree or program requirements) of each institution of higher learning in which the individual is interested. The VA shall provide a veteran who is certified as eligible for VA educational assistance with information on education counseling services and articulation agreements.
