  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Save Our Water Act

This bill amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) to suspend during droughts the application of the ESA to water releases from water storage facilities by federal and state agencies in a navigable river basin.

The bill prohibits a state from enforcing ESA requirements in an area of the state in which a suspension applies, but does not affect the authority of a state to carry out and enforce its own laws.

The bill does not prohibit any release of water from a water storage facility under the ESA if a relevant authority certifies that such release will not cause harm to the economy and no water conservation measures will be required to be taken by any water users as a result of such release.</summary>
