This bill reaffirms federal recognition and the rights and privileges of the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in Cheboygan County, Michigan. The band is eligible for all federal services and benefits available to other federally recognized Indian tribes.

The Department of the Interior must acquire land in Cheboygan County, Michigan, and other geographic areas and must hold these lands in trust for the benefit of the band.

This bill sets forth criteria and evidentiary requirements for determining the initial membership of the band. The band must provide a copy of its base roll to the Bureau of Indian Affairs within one year.

The initial constitution of the band shall be the constitution submitted by the band to the Office of Federal Acknowledgment on May 2, 2005.</summary>
