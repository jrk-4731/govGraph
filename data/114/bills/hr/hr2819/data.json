Specifically, it exempts health plans from the requirement to cover preventive services without cost-sharing and the requirement to comply with annual out-of-pocket spending limits. It also exempts health plans in the individual and small group markets from the requirement to cover essential health benefits and the requirement to limit age-related premium variation."
