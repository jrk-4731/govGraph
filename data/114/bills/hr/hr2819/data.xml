This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise requirements for private health insurance plans in a state with a federal health insurance exchange. Specifically, it exempts health plans from the requirement to cover preventive services without cost-sharing and the requirement to comply with annual out-of-pocket spending limits. It also exempts health plans in the individual and small group markets from the requirement to cover essential health benefits and the requirement to limit age-related premium variation.</summary>
