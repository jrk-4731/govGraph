The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nHighlights: \n\nThis bill provides continuing appropriations for most federal agencies through the earlier of April 28, 2017, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.\n\nIt is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing CR expires on December 9, 2016, because eleven of the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted. (The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 was enacted earlier this year.)\n\nThe bill funds most projects and activities at the rate established for FY2017 spending by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The bill also includes several exceptions, known as anomalies, which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.\n\nThe bill also includes additional emergency, disaster relief, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.\n\nThe bill extends several programs that are otherwise scheduled to expire, including health benefits for certain retired miners and their families.\n\nFull Summary: \n\nFurther Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\n(Sec. 3) Specifies that references to \"this Act\" included in division B of this bill refer only to the provisions of that division.\n\n(Sec. 4) Specifies the each amount in this bill designated by Congress as an emergency requirement is contingent on the President also designating all of the emergency amounts and transmitting the designations to Congress.\n\nSpecifies that each amount in this bill designated by Congress for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism is contingent on the President also designating all of the amounts and transmitting the designations to Congress.\n\nFurther Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nDIVISION A--FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017\n\nProvides continuing appropriations to most federal agencies through April 28, 2017, or the enactment of specified appropriations legislation.\n\n(Unless otherwise indicated, all extensions and provisions referenced in the summary are for the duration of the CR.)\n\n(Sec. 101) Amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 to: (1) provide FY2017 appropriations through April 28, 2017, to most federal agencies for continuing projects or activities at the levels of, and under the terms and conditions of FY2016 appropriations Acts; and (2) reduce the across-the-board reduction included in the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017.\n\nContinues all provisions included in the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 (except where this bill provides otherwise) and adds the following new provisions:\n\n(Sec. 146) Permits Department of Agriculture (USDA) funds provided for the Farm Service Agency's Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Program Account to be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to fund loans for which applications are approved.\n\n(Sec. 147) Permits funds provided to USDA for Child Nutrition Programs to be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to ensure that the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children demonstration projects are operational by May 2017.
