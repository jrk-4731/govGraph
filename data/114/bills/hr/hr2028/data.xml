  <summary date="2016-12-11T04:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since the House agreed to the Senate amendment with an amendment on December 8, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Highlights: 

This bill provides continuing appropriations for most federal agencies through the earlier of April 28, 2017, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation.

It is commonly referred to as a continuing resolution (CR) and prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing CR expires on December 9, 2016, because eleven of the twelve FY2017 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have not been enacted. (The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 was enacted earlier this year.)

The bill funds most projects and activities at the rate established for FY2017 spending by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The bill also includes several exceptions, known as anomalies, which provide funding flexibility and additional appropriations for various programs.

The bill also includes additional emergency, disaster relief, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding which is exempt from discretionary spending limits.

The bill extends several programs that are otherwise scheduled to expire, including health benefits for certain retired miners and their families.
