 This bill makes it an unlawful employment practice for certain employers to seek information concerning a job applicant's salary history.

 An exception is established authorizing an employer to seek such information in a case in which the employer has made an offer of employment, including the compensation amount, to the applicant and the applicant volunteers such information and provides written authorization to the employer authorizing the employer to verify such information
