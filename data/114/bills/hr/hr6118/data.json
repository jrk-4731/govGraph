    "text": "Financial Services Innovation Act of 2016\n\nThis bill requires specified federal departments and agencies (agencies) to periodically publish in the Federal Register a nonexclusive list identifying three or more areas of existing regulation:\n\n that apply or may apply to a financial innovation offered or intended to be offered by a covered person, and that the agency would consider modifying or waiving if it were to receive a petition from the covered person in accordance with this bill relating to that regulation. The bill defines \"a covered person\" as a person that offers or intends to offer a financial innovation by submitting a petition to a Financial Services Innovation Office (FSIO) at one or more agencies.\n\nEach agency shall establish its own FSIO to:\n\n promote financial innovations, and assist covered persons whose petitions have been approved pursuant to this bill. Each agency, through its FSIO, shall:\n\n support the development of financial innovations; coordinate with FSIOs at other agencies to share information and data; and establish procedures to reduce the time and cost of offering a financial innovation to the public and enable greater access to financial innovations. The agencies shall create a FSIO Liaison Committee which shall consult on the administration, coordination, and oversight of each agency's FSIO."
