    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 10, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nNational Park Service Centennial Act\n\nTITLE I--NATIONAL PARK CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE FUND\n\n(Sec. 101) This bill establishes the National Park Centennial Challenge Fund to finance signature projects and programs to enhance the National Park System.\n\nAll amounts received from sales by the National Park Service (NPS) of National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Passes that exceed $10 million shall be deposited into the Challenge Fund as offsetting collections and shall remain available until expended.\n\nFunds collected and deposited into the Challenge Fund:\n\n shall be used for projects or programs approved by Interior to further the mission of the NPS and to enhance visitor experience in system units; may not be used for the acquisition of lands or interests in lands; and may only be used if matched, on at least a 1-to-1 basis, by nonfederal donations (including funds and fairly valued durable goods and materials) to the NPS for signature projects or programs. Interior shall:\n\n develop a list of signature projects and programs eligible for funding from the Challenge Fund; submit such list to Congress; and prioritize deferred maintenance projects, physical improvements to visitor services facilities, and trail maintenance. Interior may periodically add any signature project or program to the list and notify Congress of such addition.\n\n Interior shall provide, with the President's annual budget submission, a summary of the status and funding of signature projects and programs.\n\n(Sec. 102) Interior (for a federal land management agency) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) (for the Forest Service) shall make the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass available to any U.S. citizen or person residing in the United States who is 62 years of age or older for:\n\n a period of 12 months from the date of issuance at a cost of $20; and the lifetime of the passholder at a cost (currently $10) equal to the cost of the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass. The bill requires Interior and USDA to make the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass available for no additional cost, if the individual provides evidence that he or she has purchased a 12-month pass for each of the four previous years.\n\nTITLE II--NATIONAL PARK FOUNDATION ENDOWMENT\n\nNational Park Foundation Endowment Act\n\n(Sec. 202) The National Park Foundation shall establish the Second Century Endowment for the National Park Service as a special account.\n\nWith respect to the endowment:\n\n $10 million shall be deposited into it from amounts received from the sales of Federal Recreational Lands Passes, and in addition to deposits otherwise authorized, it shall consist of any gifts, devises, or bequests provided to the National Park Foundation. Funds in the endowment shall be made available to the National Park Foundation as offsetting collections for projects and activities approved by Interior that further the NPS mission and purposes.\n\nGifts, devises, or bequests in the endowment and any accrued interest or dividends earned thereon, shall be available to the National Park Foundation for such projects and activities.\n\nNo federal funds received for the endowment may be used by the National Park Foundation for administrative expenses.\n\nTITLE III--NATIONAL PARK NEXT GENERATION STEWARDS\n\n(Sec. 301) Interior shall ensure that management of system units and related areas is enhanced by the availability and use of a broad program of the highest quality interpretation and education.\n\nInterior may undertake a program of regular evaluation of interpretation and education programs to ensure that they:\n\n adjust to how people learn and engage with the natural world and shared heritage as embodied in the NPS; reflect different cultural backgrounds, ages, education, gender, abilities, ethnicity, and needs; demonstrate innovative approaches to management and incorporate emerging learning and communications technology; and reflect current scientific and academic research, content, methods, and audience analysis. Interior may:\n\n coordinate with park partners and volunteers in the delivery of quality programs and services to supplement those provided by the NPS as part of a park's Long Range Interpretive Plan; support interpretive partners by providing opportunities to participate in interpretive training; and collaborate with other organizations to develop, promote, and make available educational opportunities related to resources of the system and programs. (Sec. 302) The Public Lands Corps Act of 1993 is amended to: (1) increase from 25 to 30 the age limit for Public Lands Corps participants, and (2) extend from 120 days to 2 years the period during which noncompetitive hiring status may be given to a former corps participant.\n\n(Sec. 303) The bill increases funding for the Volunteers-In-Parks Program.\n\nTITLE IV--NATIONAL PARK FOUNDATION AUTHORITIES\n\n(Sec. 401) The Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the National Park Foundation shall be non-voting, ex officio members of the Foundation Board (currently, the Secretary and the Director are voting members).\n\nThe Chairman of the board shall be elected by the board from among its members for a two-year term. (Currently, the Secretary shall be the Board Chairman and the Director shall be Board Secretary.)\n\nActivities of the National Park Foundation to solicit, accept, administer, and use any gifts, devises, or bequests for the benefit of, or in connection with, the NPS, shall be undertaken after consultation with the Director to ensure that these activities are consistent with NPS programs and policies.\n\n(Sec. 402) The bill reauthorizes the National Park Foundation through FY2023.\n\nAmounts made available under such reauthorization:\n\n may be advanced each fiscal year to the National Park Foundation in a lump sum without regard as to when expenses are incurred, and shall be provided to the National Park Foundation for use to match contributions made to the Foundation. No funds made available under such reauthorization may be used by the National Park Foundation for administrative expenses. Nor may the foundation deposit such funds into any fund that will be invested or earn interest in any way.\n\nTITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n(Sec. 501) The bill adds the General Chairman of the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers to the membership of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.\n\nAfter January 20, 2017, the council chairman shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, serve at the President's will, serve full time, and be compensated at the rate for Level V of the Executive Schedule Pay Rates.\n\nThe chairman shall serve for a four-year term and may be reappointed once, for a total of up to eight years of service. The term of a chairman shall start on January 20 after each general presidential election.\n\nThe council chairmen, before the first appointment of a chairman in accordance with this bill, shall receive $100 per diem when engaged in the performance of council duties, and shall receive reimbursement for necessary traveling and subsistence expenses incurred in their performance.\n\n(Sec. 502) Interior may propose to amend the terms of an existing concessions contract to provide new and additional services where they are determined necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the system unit in which they are located and are highly consistent with the preservation and conservation of the unit's resources and values.
