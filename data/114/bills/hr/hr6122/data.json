An IHE that uses electronic instructional materials or related technologies that do not fully conform to the voluntary guidelines qualifies for a limited safe harbor from monetary liability under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 if the IHE complies with specified requirements."
