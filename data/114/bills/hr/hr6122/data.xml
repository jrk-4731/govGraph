This bill directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the Secretary of Education to establish an independent commission to develop and issue voluntary accessibility guidelines for postsecondary electronic instructional materials and an annotated list of information technology standards.

The Department of Education must review and, as appropriate, update the voluntary guidelines and information technology standards every five years.

An institution of higher education (IHE) that uses electronic instructional materials or related technologies that conform to the voluntary guidelines is deemed to be in compliance with its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. An IHE that uses electronic instructional materials or related technologies that do not fully conform to the voluntary guidelines qualifies for a limited safe harbor from monetary liability under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 if the IHE complies with specified requirements.</summary>
