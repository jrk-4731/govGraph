This bill amends the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that a veteran may elect to receive health care treatment and services in a qualifying non-VA facility if: (1) the veteran is enrolled in the VA health care system and resides not more than 50 miles from the nearest VA facility that the Secretary has identified in a prospectus level lease request as being deficient with respect to providing certain treatment or services or as needing expansion; and (2) the Secretary determines that such deficiency has not been resolved or such expansion has not occurred.</summary>
