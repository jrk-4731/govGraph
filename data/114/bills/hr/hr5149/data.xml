  <summary date="2016-04-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat ambulance services as reimbursable emergency services if:

 the ambulance request was made because of the sudden onset of a medical condition of such nature that a prudent layperson would have reasonably expected that a delay in seeking immediate medical attention would have been hazardous to the individual or could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the individual in serious jeopardy, and the individual is transported to the closest and most appropriate medical facility capable of treating such emergency medical condition.</summary>
