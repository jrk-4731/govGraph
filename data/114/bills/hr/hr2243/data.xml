(Sec. 3) This bill requires the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to: (1) suspend immediately the compensation packages approved for 2015 for the chief executive officers of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs); and (2) establish, in lieu of such packages, the compensation and benefits for each such officer at the same level in effect as of January 1, 2015.

Such compensation and benefits may not thereafter be increased.

This requirement may not be construed to affect the applicability to the chief executive officer of each GSE of the prohibition against receiving bonuses during any period of conservatorship on or after April 4, 2012.

(Sec. 4) Any executive officer affected by this Act shall not be considered a federal employee.</summary>
