The Department of Justice must allocate specified funds for testing and auditing backlogged rape kits.\n\nThe bill amends the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 to:\n\n narrow the scope of grant program funds subject to a reduction for a state's failure to comply with national prison rape standards, revise and expand requirements with respect to adopting national prison rape standards, and require background checks for compliance auditors. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to revise and reauthorize the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program.\n\n Effective Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2015\n\nThis bill requires an application for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program funds to include a statewide strategic plan to improve the administration of criminal justice."
