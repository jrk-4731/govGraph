This bill directs the Department of Commerce to: (1) maintain and operate at least one Doppler weather radar site within 55 miles of each city in the United States with a population of more than 700,000, and (2) ensure that each such radar is available to the office of the National Weather Service that provides services to that city.

Commerce shall ensure that each such radar conforms with the same standards that apply to radars operated by Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including standards relating to the use of dual-polarization technology or other technologies included in Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) radars.

When determining the location for construction of a radar meeting the requirements of this Act, Commerce shall consider nearby counties that have populations over 130,000 and do not otherwise have radar beam coverage below 10,00 feet from such Doppler radars.

Commerce shall report to Congress on the Doppler weather radar sites that need to be constructed or acquired to meet this Act's requirements.</summary>
