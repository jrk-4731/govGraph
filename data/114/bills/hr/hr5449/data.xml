This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise requirements related to the provision of&#160;adequate representation&#160;for defendants in federal criminal cases. Under current law, each U.S. district court must operate a plan, in accordance with specified requirements,&#160;for furnishing representation to any eligible person who is financially unable to obtain adequate representation. The bill&#160;revises these requirements and&#160;establishes the Federal Defender Commission as an independent agency tasked with ensuring the provision of adequate representation.</summary>
