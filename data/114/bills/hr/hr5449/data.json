Under current law, each U.S. district court must operate a plan, in accordance with specified requirements,\u00a0for furnishing representation to any eligible person who is financially unable to obtain adequate representation. The bill\u00a0revises these requirements and\u00a0establishes the Federal Defender Commission as an independent agency tasked with ensuring the provision of adequate representation."
