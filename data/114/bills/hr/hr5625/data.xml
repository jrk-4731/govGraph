Modernizing Government Travel Act

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to prescribe regulations to provide for the reimbursement of federal employees traveling on official business for the use of a transportation network company or innovative mobility technology. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall prescribe such regulations with respect to judicial branch employees.

An "innovative mobility technology company" is an entity that applies technology to expand and enhance available transportation choices, better manage demand for transportation services, and provide alternatives to driving alone.

A "transportation network company" is an entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers affiliated with such entity in order for a driver to provide transportation services to a rider.

(Sec. 3) The bill revises the reporting requirements regarding payments pertaining to official travel.

By November 31 of each year, each agency shall submit to the GSA, in a format prescribed by it and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), an analysis of the total costs of transportation service by type and the total number of trips utilizing each transportation type for purposes of official travel.

The GSA shall make the data submitted publicly available upon receipt.

By January 31 of each year, the GSA shall submit to the OMB and to specified congressional committees: (1) an analysis of the data submitted for specified agencies (as listed under a provision regarding the establishment of agency Chief Financial Officers), and (2) a description of any new regulations promulgated or changes to existing regulations authorized.</summary>
