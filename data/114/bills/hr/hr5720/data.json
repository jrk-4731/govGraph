    "text": "Checkpoint Safety Act of 2016\n\nThis bill revises minimum requirements for the deployment of armed law enforcement personnel at security screening locations at certain airports.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA), formerly the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security of the Department of Transportation, shall order the deployment of at least one armed law enforcement officer within 300 feet of the security screening location and within the terminal during operating hours of each airport having annual enplanements of eight million or more or international enplanements of one million or more. The TSA shall order the deployment of additional armed law enforcement officers at such airports if deemed necessary to ensure airport security.\n\nThe bill revises air transportation security program requirements to provide that such programs ensure:\n\n law enforcement presence at each airport is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers, as under current law, and their property; close cooperation between all relevant parties in ensuring airport security; high training standards for all security and law enforcement personnel; prompt notification of, and law enforcement response to, any security incidents at airports, including detention of persons who attempt to evade transportation security screening; and multiple means for TSA Officers or members of the public to request prompt law enforcement assistance in the airport. The bill repeals TSA authority for allowing deputized state and local law enforcement officers to be stationed other than at airport security screening locations."
