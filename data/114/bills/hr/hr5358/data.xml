This bill establishes the Penn School - Reconstruction Era National Monument in South Carolina, which shall become a unit of the National Park System (NPS) when the Department of the Interior has:

 acquired sufficient land or an interest in land within the monument's boundary to constitute a manageable unit, and entered into a written agreement with Penn Community Services, Inc. (known as Penn Center) pursuant to this bill. The bill declares that the monument's boundaries shall be the same as those of the Penn Center National Historic Landmark District.

Interior may enter into an agreement with Penn Center:

 regarding the transfer of land or interests in land; and delineating the respective roles and responsibilities of the National Park Service and Penn Center in the operation, maintenance, and interpretation of the monument. Interior may acquire by donation, purchase from a willing seller, or exchange lands or interests in land within the monument's boundary and within its vicinity.</summary>
