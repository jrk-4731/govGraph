This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to establish a program to decrease the number of Border Patrol agents who are removed from border security operations for the purpose of accompanying to medical treatment facilities ill or injured individuals interdicted by the Border Patrol.

Such program shall place appropriate medical personnel from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at Border Patrol stations along the southwest border to ensure that Border Patrol agents are able to prioritize securing the international borders of the United States.

The CBP, in coordination with the Chief Medical Officer of DHS, shall submit a report on implementation of such program, including a list of Border Patrol stations within which the program is operational, statistics on Border Patrol agent hours spent on border security operations that would have otherwise been spent accompanying ill or injured detainees to medical treatment facilities, and an estimation of efficiencies and cost savings from such program.</summary>
