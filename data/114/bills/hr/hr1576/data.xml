  <summary date="2015-03-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Generic Complex Drugs Safety and Effectiveness for Patients Act of 2015

This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study whether generic versions of certain complex drugs or certain biological drugs face significantly different challenges in meeting the approval standards of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) than generic versions of small-molecule drugs. (Complex drugs and biological drugs can be composed of large molecules that are more difficult to fully characterize than small molecules, so it can be more difficult to demonstrate that generic versions of these drugs are the same as the brand name versions.)

If the GAO determines that these generic drugs face significantly different challenges, then the GAO must also determine: (1) the evidence that should be required to demonstrate that one of these generic drugs is sufficiently similar to the brand name drug in safety, composition, and activity; (2) whether the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act should be amended to address the approval of these generic drugs; and (3) whether the FDA should develop a policy document on the evidence that is necessary to obtain approval of these generic drugs.</summary>
