        <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Israel motion to recommit H.R. 1731 with instructions, pending reservation of a point of order. The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize the sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures in the following areas: (1) the security of critical infrastructure, including the electrical grid, nuclear power plants, oil and gas pipelines, financial services, and transportation systems; (2) the protection of intellectual property of U.S. corporations, including small and medium sized businesses; and (3) the privacy and property rights of at-risk Americans, including medical records. Subsequently, the reservation of a point of order was withdrawn.</text>
