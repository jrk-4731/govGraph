The prize competitions should be designed to help the United States achieve its goal of developing new and effective ways to advance the understanding, monitoring, and sustainability of coral reef ecosystems.\n\nPriority is given to establish programs that address communities, environments, or industries that are in distress due to the decline or degradation of coral reef ecosystems."
