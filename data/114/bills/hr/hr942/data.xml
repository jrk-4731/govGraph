  <summary date="2015-02-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Audit the Pentagon Act of 2015 

This bill reduces discretionary spending by 0.5% for federal agencies that have either not submitted a financial statement for a fiscal year or have submitted a financial statement that has not received an unqualified or a qualified audit opinion by an independent external auditor.

The bill excludes specified Department of Defense (DOD) accounts for personnel and the Defense Health Program from the reductions.

The President may waive the reductions for any account by certifying that the cuts would harm national security or members of the Armed Forces who are in combat.

The bill establishes reporting requirements for the Office of Management and Budget and DOD.</summary>
