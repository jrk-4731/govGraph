Of the amounts in the Fund as of the date of enactment of this Act: (1) a specified amount shall be transferred to the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund, and (2) the remainder shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury to be used only for reducing the budget deficit.</summary>
