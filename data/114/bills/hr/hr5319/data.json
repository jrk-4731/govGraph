The bill establishes a process for allocating the totals among congressional committees, agencies, programs, and major functional categories.\n\nThe bill establishes procedures for enforcing the requirements, including:\n\n points of order which may be raised against legislation to enforce the allocations, subject to a waiver by Congress; private rights of action in federal court; and a requirement for appropriations legislation to include enforcement provisions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) must submit: (1) a baseline projecting the federal regulatory cost over at least five years, (2) analysis of the federal regulatory cost of legislation reported by congressional committees, and (3) look-back reviews comparing CBO estimates with actual costs.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the CBO must submit jointly to the President and Congress an analysis of the cost and economic effects of federal regulations, including recommendations for improvements to the regulatory budgeting process.\n\nFederal agencies and the Government Accountability Office must provide reports and cost estimates for specified regulations."
