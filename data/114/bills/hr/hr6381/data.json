DHS must: (1) disseminate information to prevent drone attacks; (2) establish task forces and cooperate with foreign governments on border enforcement and security at airports and ports; (3) authorize the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to provide employees and services to ports in exchange for a fee; and (4) defend food, agriculture, and veterinary systems from terrorism and other high-consequence events.\n\nVisa security requirements are provided for: (1) the Department of State to assign employees to visa-issuing diplomatic and consular posts to screen applications against criminal, national security, and terrorism databases; (2) a visa security advisory opinion unit within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and (3) the CBP to screen electronic passports though an embedded chip and utilize facial recognition technology.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must enter into memoranda of understanding with other DHS offices to award grants to:\n\n public transportation agencies to improve security under the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007; high-risk urban areas and state, local, and tribal governments to protect against terrorism under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP); and port authorities, facility operators, and state and local governments to implement security plans and train law enforcement personnel. State planning committees or urban working groups that assist in the determination of funding priorities under the UASI and the SHSGP must include: (1) public health officials and medical practitioners, (2) educational institutions, (3) state and regional interoperable communications coordinators, and (4) state and major urban area fusion centers that share threat-related information. FEMA must permit grants to be used for medical preparedness to terrorism.\n\nThe bill codifies: (1) Operation Stonegarden for FEMA to enhance border security by making grants to law enforcement agencies involved in CBP operations in states that border Canada or Mexico or that have a maritime border; and (2) Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers that train government, international, and private agencies.\n\nThe bill sets forth requirements concerning:\n\n medical response to anthrax, pandemics, emerging infectious diseases, and chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attacks; flood insurance claims processing; the reorganization of cybersecurity, infrastructure protection, emergency communications, and protective services under a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency headed by a Director of National Cybersecurity; maritime cybersecurity information sharing; allowable uses of public transportation security assistance grant funds; research and development for cybersecurity technologies; and oversight of DHS vehicle fleets.
