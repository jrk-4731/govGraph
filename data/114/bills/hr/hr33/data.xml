  <summary date="2015-02-28T04:59:59Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on February 27, 2015. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

This bill amends the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 to extend the continuing FY2015 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the current annual rate until the earlier of March 6, 2015, or enactment of DHS appropriations legislation for FY2015. The bill prevents a shutdown of DHS when funding under current law expires on February 27, 2015.</summary>
