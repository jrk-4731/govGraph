This bill prohibits the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) from requiring centralized delivery (whereby mail receptacles of a number of delivery points are grouped or clustered at a single location) for certain residential housing units that: (1) were approved, before April 5, 2012, for construction; (2) would have been eligible for curbside delivery had they been constructed before such date; and (3) were not approved to receive such curbside delivery as of such date.

The USPS must establish curbside delivery (whereby a mail receptacle is situated at the edge of a sidewalk abutting a road or curb, or at a road or curb, and can be served by a letter carrier from a motorized vehicle) for such units.</summary>
