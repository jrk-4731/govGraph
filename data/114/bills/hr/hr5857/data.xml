  <summary date="2016-07-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Beginning Farmers Agenda Act of 2016 

This bill amends various agricultural laws to modify and establish programs to assist beginning farmers.

The bill makes land trusts eligible for certain assistance under the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Conservation Easement Program. In administering the program, USDA may prioritize an application for purchasing an easement that maintains agricultural viability, requires subsequent purchases to be at agricultural value, or both.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income up to $250,000 in gains from the sale or exchange of certain agricultural property to a beginning, socially disadvantaged, or veteran farmer or rancher, subject to specified conditions.

The bill modifies several agricultural programs to:

 require the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to prequalify loan applicants, increase and index for inflation the limit on the amount of USDA farm ownership loans per borrower, establish minimum funding requirements for agriculture land easements and wetland reserve easements, transfer jurisdiction of the Advisory Committee on Beginning Farmers and Ranchers to the FSA, establish an online customer self-service portal, reauthorize the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, and authorize grants for farm viability programs. The FSA must assign state coordinators to promote communication with beginning farmers or ranchers and increase their access to USDA programs.

The General Services Administration may sell surplus farm equipment or property to socially disadvantaged, veteran, or beginning farmers and ranchers.

The bill provides funding for: (1) the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Individual Development Accounts Pilot Program, and (2) the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program.</summary>
