This bill requires federal law enforcement officers to report to the Department of Justice (DOJ) facts and circumstances surrounding an individual's injury or death while in custody. It imposes criminal penalties&#8212;a fine and three-year mandatory minimum prison term&#8212;on a federal law enforcement officer who knowingly fails to submit a report or submits a false report.

Additionally, the bill requires a state or local government that receives funds under specified grant programs to enact a law that requires state or local law enforcement officers to submit substantially similar reports. DOJ must reduce by 10% the allocation of specified grant program funds for a state or local government that fails to enact such law.</summary>
