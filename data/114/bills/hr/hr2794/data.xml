  <summary date="2015-06-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Strengthen and Unite Communities with Civics Education and English Development Act of 2015

This bill amends the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act to: (1) award grants to states for integrated English literacy, U.S. history, and civics education programs; and (2) expand certain federally funded adult education and literacy activities to include such programs.

 This bill establishes the Office of Citizenship and Immigrant Integration to form national goals, assess and coordinate policies, and assist with other efforts related to new Americans. The office may award grants to states to form and operate State New American Councils to, among other activities: (1) develop, implement, or enhance plans to introduce new immigrants to a state; and (2) disseminate best practices pertaining to English acquisition and civics education.

The bill also establishes, as part of the general business credit, a tax credit for employer-provided adult English literacy and basic education programs. For the taxable year, the employer's credit is an amount equal to 20% of qualified education program expenses, or no more than $1,000 per full-time employee participating in the program.

In addition, the bill establishes the Presidential Award for Business Leadership in Promoting United States Citizenship to recognize businesses and other organizations, and a citizen award program to recognize naturalized citizens who have made an outstanding contribution to the United States.</summary>
