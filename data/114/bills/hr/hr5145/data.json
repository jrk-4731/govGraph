The bill prohibits a state agency from using or disclosing such technologies except for purposes of administering a state Medicaid program or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). A state agency shall have in effect adequate data security and control policies to ensure that access to such information is restricted to authorized persons for authorized uses.\n\nThe bill places $5 million in the Medicaid Improvement Fund to be available beginning in FY2021."
