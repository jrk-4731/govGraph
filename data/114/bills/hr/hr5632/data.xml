This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a program to provide compensation to communities in which a nuclear waste storage facility is located.

DOE must provide payments equal to $15 per kilogram of spent nuclear fuel stored at the nuclear waste facility.

Each local government within the jurisdictional boundaries of a nuclear waste facility must submit an annual application to DOE for compensation. DOE may make only one payment per fiscal year to eligible local governments.</summary>
