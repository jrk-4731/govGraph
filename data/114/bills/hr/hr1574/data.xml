  <summary date="2015-03-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Students Helping Young Students Act of 2015

Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education (IHEs) that receive grants for federal work-study programs to use a portion of such funding to compensate students employed in the educational after-school, before-school, or out-of-school community service activities of public elementary or secondary schools.

Requires the IHEs operating such work-study programs to give priority to public elementary or secondary schools serving low-income communities.

Allows the federal share of the compensation provided to work-study students performing such community service to exceed 75%.</summary>
