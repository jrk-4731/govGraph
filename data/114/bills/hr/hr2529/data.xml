  <summary date="2015-05-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Reducing food-based Inorganic Compounds Exposure Act of 2015 or the RICE Act

This bill directs the Food and Drug Administration to promulgate a final regulation establishing the minimum quantity of inorganic arsenic contained in rice or a rice product that will cause sale of the rice or rice product to be prohibited.

The regulation must: (1) apply the minimum quantity to rice and rice products regardless of the origin of the arsenic, (2) include the establishment of tolerances, and (3) establish a standard for inorganic arsenic that is based on the maximum achievable reduction in health risks and is protective of the long-term health of children.</summary>
