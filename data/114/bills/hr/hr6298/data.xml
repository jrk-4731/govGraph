This bill declares that Congress opposes politically motivated boycotts, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel.

The bill amends the Export Administration Act of 1979 to declare that it shall be U.S. policy to oppose:

 requests by foreign countries to impose restrictive practices or boycotts against other countries friendly to the United States or against U.S. persons; and restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by an international governmental organization, or requests to impose such practices or boycotts, against Israel. The bill prohibits U.S. persons engaged in interstate or foreign commerce from:

 requesting the imposition of any boycott by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States; or supporting any boycott fostered or imposed by an international organization, or requesting imposition of any such boycott, against Israel. The bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to include as a reason for the Export-Import Bank to deny credit applications for the export of goods and services between the United States and foreign countries, opposition to policies and actions that are politically motivated and are intended to penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with citizens or residents of Israel, entities organized under the laws of Israel, or the Government of Israel.</summary>
