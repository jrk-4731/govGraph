(Sec. 1) This bill directs a member of the Armed Forces, a civilian Department of Defense (DOD) employee, or a contractor employee working on a military installation who is required by federal regulation or state law to report known or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect to make the report directly to State Child Protective Services or another appropriate state agency in addition to the member's or employee's chain of command or any designated DOD point of contact.

DOD shall ensure that such individuals receive appropriate training in accordance with state guidelines to improve their: (1) ability to recognize evidence of child abuse and neglect, and (2) understanding of mandatory reporting requirements.</summary>
