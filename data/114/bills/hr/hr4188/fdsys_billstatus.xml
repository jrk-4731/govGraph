          <text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)</p> <p><b>Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015</b></p> TITLE I--AUTHORIZATIONS <p>(Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for FY2016-FY2017 as well as an end-of-year strength for active duty personnel of 43,000 for each of them and specified average military training student loads.</p> <p>The President shall submit to Congress along with the FY2017, FY2019, and quadrennial budgets a Coast Guard manpower requirements plan.</p> <p>There must be a prior authorization of appropriations for the Coast Guard Reserve program and the removal of bridges over U.S. navigable waters that obstruct navigation. But the requirement for prior authorization of appropriations shall no longer apply to research, development, test, or evaluation related to intelligence systems and capabilities.</p> <p>The Coast Guard may use certain FY2016-FY2017 funds to select a design for and construct an icebreaker capable of buoy tending to enhance icebreaking capacity on the Great Lakes. The bill authorizes appropriations for these fiscal years for preacquisition activities for a new polar icebreaker, including initial specification development and feasibility studies.</p> <p>TITLE II--COAST GUARD</p> <p>(Sec. 201) The grade of the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard shall be increased from vice admiral to admiral, and the Chief of Staff of the Coast Guard shall be a vice admiral.</p> <p>(Sec. 202) The President may designate within the executive branch, outside the Coast Guard or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce, positions of importance and responsibility held by officers with the grade of vice admiral.</p> <p>(Sec. 203) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may have remitted or cancelled any part of a person's indebtedness to the United States or any U.S. instrumentality if: (1) the indebtedness was incurred while the person served on active duty as a Coast Guard member; and (2) remitting or cancelling the indebtedness is in the best U.S. interest.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) The test and evaluation master plan for any Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition project or program must identify:</p> <ul> <li>the performance data to be used to determine whether key performance parameters have been resolved, and </li> <li>the test and evaluation results required to demonstrate that a capability, asset, or subsystem meets performance requirements.</li> </ul> <p>The report accompanying the Coast Guard's annual capital investment plan shall include a life-cycle cost estimate and specified impact assessments for each new capital asset, as well as recommended funding levels.</p> <p>The Coast Guard shall:</p> <ul> <li>implement a standard for tracking operational days at sea for cutters that does not include days during which they are undergoing maintenance or repair;</li> <li>submit to Congress a revised fleet mix analysis of Coast Guard fixed wing aircraft;</li> <li>include in the biennial long-term major acquisitions plan the numbers and types of cutters and aircraft to be decommissioned or to be acquired, together with certain estimated funding levels; and</li> <li>report to Congress quarterly updates of the assessment of the risks associated with all current major acquisition programs.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 205) The Coast Guard Auxiliary may patrol a waterway only if: (1) it is navigable for purposes of the Coast Guard jurisdiction, or (2) a state or other proper authority has requested the patrol.</p> <p>The Coast Guard shall review the waterways patrolled by the Auxiliary in the most recently completed fiscal year to determine whether they are eligible or ineligible for patrol.</p> <p>(Sec. 206) The bill reduces from 90 to 30 days the deadline for the Coast Guard to notify Congress before approving a community as Coast Guard City, USA.</p> <p>(Sec. 207) The Coast Guard may contract for the acquisition of Polar Icebreakers and associated equipment using incremental funding. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (the Secretary in this Act unless otherwise noted) shall:</p> <ul> <li>complete a materiel condition assessment with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Polar Sea, and</li> <li>determine whether it is cost effective to reactivate the Polar Sea when compared with other options as part of a strategy to maintain polar icebreaking services.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 208) The Secretary may not before January 1, 2018: (1) close a Coast Guard air facility that was in operation on November 30, 2014; or (2) retire, transfer, relocate, or deploy an aviation asset from such an air facility for the purpose of closing it.</p> <p>The Secretary may close or terminate operations at such an air facility after that date only if:</p> <ul> <li> remaining search and rescue capabilities maintain the safety of the maritime public in the facility's area;</li> <li>regional or local prevailing weather and marine conditions, including water temperatures or unusual tide and current conditions, do not require the facility's continued operation; and</li> <li>Coast Guard search and rescue standards related to search and response times are met.</li> </ul> <p>The Secretary may, however, implement any reasonable management efficiencies within an air station and air facility network, such as modifying the operational posture of units or reallocating resources as necessary to ensure the safety of the maritime public nationwide.</p> <p>The Secretary shall develop and submit to Congress rotary wing strategic plans, including contingency and capital investment plans, to adequately address contingencies arising from potential future aviation casualties or the planned or unplanned retirement of rotary wing airframes to avoid to the greatest extent practicable any substantial gap or diminishment in Coast Guard operational capabilities.</p> <p>(Sec. 210) The Secretary shall establish a process for the discontinuance of an aid to navigation (other than a seasonal or temporary aid) established, maintained, or operated by the Coast Guard.</p> <p>(Sec. 211) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall assess the efficacy of the Coast Guard's Standard Operational Planning Process with respect to annual mission performance measures.</p> <p>(Sec. 212) If DHS determines that there are at least two such communications systems certified by the Department of Defense Joint Interoperability Test Center (DOD JITC), the Secretary shall carry out a pilot program across at least three components of the DHS to assess the effectiveness of a communications system that:</p> <ul> <li>provides for multiagency collaboration and interoperability and wide-area, secure, and peer-invitation-based and acceptance-based multimedia communications;</li> <li>is DOD JITC-certified;
