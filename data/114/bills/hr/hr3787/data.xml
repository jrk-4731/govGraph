This bill requires that projects, especially the highest performing projects, included in an adopted metropolitan area transportation plan be selected through a publicly available transparent process using criteria that directly support specified factors, national transportation goals, and applicable state transportation goals.

Projects included in the priority list for a metropolitan transportation improvement program (TIP) shall come from the highest performing category of projects identified in the transportation plan; and if a lower-categorized project is prioritized before a higher-categorized project, a public description explaining why must be included in the list.

These same requirements shall apply to a long-range statewide transportation plan as well as a statewide TIP.</summary>
