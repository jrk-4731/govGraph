This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose as of January 1, 2017, an excise tax on the production or importation of a taxable carbon substance (i.e., coal, oil, and natural gas), payable by the producer, miner, or importer of such substance. The tax does not apply to exports of a taxable carbon substance.

The bill requires the Department of the Treasury to: (1) impose carbon equivalency fees on imports of goods containing or produced using a taxable carbon substance; and (2) make quarterly payments, from the amounts deposited pursuant to imposition of the carbon excise tax, to lawful residents of the United States with a valid social security number.</summary>
