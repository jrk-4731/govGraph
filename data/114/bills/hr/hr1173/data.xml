  <summary date="2015-02-27T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Ban Insider Trading Act of 2015

This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to make it unlawful to purchase or sell any security, or securities-based swap agreement, that is based upon information that the person knows (or should know) is material inside information.

"Inside information" is defined as information that is nonpublic and obtained:

 illegally, directly or indirectly from an issuer who expects either confidentiality or that it will only be used for a legitimate business purpose, or in violation of a fiduciary duty. "Material information" is defined as information relating to an issuer or to a security which, if it were made public, would likely have a significant effect upon the security's price.

Subjects a person to liability to prosecution for trading in prohibited securities while in possession of material nonpublic information if the person, without a legitimate business purpose, discloses intentionally to another person information that the discloser knows (or should know) is material inside information.</summary>
