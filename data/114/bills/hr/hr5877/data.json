The pilot project designation is removed from the HSARPA's cooperative research programs with Israel for border, maritime, and aviation security; explosives detection; and emergency services.\n\n The international cooperative activities report submitted every five years by the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office must contain: (1) a status update on the progress of such international cooperative activities identified in the previous reporting period; and (2) a discussion of obstacles encountered in forming, executing, or implementing agreements for such activities."
