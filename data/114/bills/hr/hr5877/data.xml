United States-Israel Advanced Research Partnership Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 to allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the Department of State, to enter cooperative programs with Israel to enhance capabilities in cybersecurity through:

 the international cooperation program established by DHS's Under Secretary for Science and Technology to enter into cooperative research activities with foreign partner governments that are allies in the global war on terrorism, and the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA). The pilot project designation is removed from the HSARPA's cooperative research programs with Israel for border, maritime, and aviation security; explosives detection; and emergency services.

 The international cooperative activities report submitted every five years by the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office must contain: (1) a status update on the progress of such international cooperative activities identified in the previous reporting period; and (2) a discussion of obstacles encountered in forming, executing, or implementing agreements for such activities.</summary>
