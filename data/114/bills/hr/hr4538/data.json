A \"covered agency\" is a state financial regulatory agency, each of the federal financial institutions regulatory agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, a law enforcement agency, a state or local agency responsible for administering adult protective service laws, or a state attorney general.\n\nA covered financial institution may provide such training to each of its supervisors, compliance officers (including a Bank Secrecy Act Officer), or registered representatives who: (1) may come into contact with a senior citizen as a regular part of duties; or (2) may review or approve the financial documents, records, or transactions of a senior citizen in connection with providing financial services."
