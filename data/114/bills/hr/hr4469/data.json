The bill amends the federal bankruptcy code to exempt HSAs from creditor claims in bankruptcy.\n\nThe bill amends the Social Security Act to reauthorize the use of Medicaid health opportunity accounts.\n\nThe bill allows a medical care tax deduction for: (1) exercise equipment, physical fitness programs, and membership at a fitness facility; (2) nutritional and dietary supplements; and (3) periodic fees paid to a primary care physician and amounts paid for pre-paid primary care services."
