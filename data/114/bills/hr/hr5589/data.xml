This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to require health insurance exchanges to verify an individual's eligibility for a special enrollment period before coverage is made effective.

Individuals seeking coverage through an exchange during a special enrollment period must submit to the exchange the documents necessary to verify their eligibility for the special enrollment period.

The Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services must report on enrollment during special enrollment periods for plan year 2015. The report must include the number of individuals who: (1) sought to enroll during a special enrollment period but were prohibited, (2) were prohibited because they did not provide documentation supporting eligibility, and (3) were prohibited because they provided invalid documentation.</summary>
