Holding Company Registration Threshold Equalization Act of 2015

 (Sec. 2) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require an issuer that is a savings and loan holding company to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission if: (1) its assets exceed $10 million, and (2) it has a class of equity security held of record by 2,000 or more persons.

Requires termination of such registration after a savings and loan holding company certifies that its holders of record of that class of security have been reduced to fewer than 1,200 persons.

Suspends automatically the duty of a savings and loan holding company to file supplementary and periodic information if the securities of each class to which the registration statement relates (other than any class of asset-backed securities) are held of record by fewer than 1,200 persons.</summary>
