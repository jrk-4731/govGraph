  <summary date="2015-04-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Improving Oversight and Accountability in Medicaid Non-DSH Supplemental Payments Act 

This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) issue guidance to states that identifies permissible methods for calculation of non-DSH (disproportionate share) supplemental payments to providers, (2) establish annual reporting requirements for states making non-DSH supplemental payments, and (3) establish requirements for states making non-DSH supplemental payments to conduct and submit to the Secretary an annual independent certified audit.

No federal payment under Medicaid may be made to a state for any expenditures to make non-DSH supplemental payments unless the state complies with the reporting and auditing requirements of this Act.</summary>
