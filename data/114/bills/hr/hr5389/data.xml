Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2016

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) engage with innovative and emerging technology developers and firms, including technology-based small businesses and startup ventures, to address homeland security needs; and (2) develop, submit to Congress, and implement a DHS-wide strategy to proactively engage with such developers and firms that focuses on sustainable methods and guidance to build relationships to establish, develop, and enhance DHS capabilities to address such needs.

DHS may establish personnel and office space in areas in the United States with high concentrations of such developers and firms, co-located with other assets of DHS or other federal facilities, where possible.

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this bill.</summary>
