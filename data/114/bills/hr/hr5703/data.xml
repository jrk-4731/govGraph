This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) to award grants to entities to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in DOD military and civilian leadership positions by carrying out: (1) online interactive workshops, (2) student mentoring programs with Armed Forces members and DOD officers and employees, (3) internships, and (4) outreach programs for elementary and secondary school students.

The term "minority" means American Indian, Alaskan Native, Black (not of Hispanic origin), Hispanic (including persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Central or South American origin), Asian (including underrepresented subgroups), Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander origin subgroup, or other ethnic group underrepresented in science and engineering.

The term "underrepresented minority" means a minority group whose numbers in DOD military and civilian leadership positions per 10,000 population of that group is substantially below the comparable figure for DOD military and civilian leaders who are White and not of Hispanic origin.</summary>
