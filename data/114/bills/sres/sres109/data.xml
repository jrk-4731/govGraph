Honors the accomplishments of the Hui Panala 'au colonists and the young men who helped secure and maintain U.S. jurisdiction over equatorial islands in the Pacific Ocean during the years leading up to and the months immediately following the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the entry of the United States into World War II.

Acknowledges the local, national, and international significance of the seven-year colonization of such islands by the United States, which resulted in the United States extending sovereignty into the Equatorial Pacific.

Recognizes the dedication of the young men, the majority of whom were Native Hawaiian, who participated in the Equatorial Pacific colonization project.

Extends condolences to the families of Carl Kahalewai, Joseph Keliihananui, and Richard Whaley for the loss of their loved ones in the service of the United States.</summary>
