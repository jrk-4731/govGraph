  <summary date="2015-06-25T14:32:44Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Observes the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide.

Affirms that the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing implemented by Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 meet the terms of genocide.

Urges the Atrocities Prevention Board, a U.S. interagency committee established by the Administration in 2012, to study the lessons of Srebrenica and issue guidance on how to prevent similar incidents from recurring in the future.

Encourages the United States to:

 reaffirm its policy of supporting the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, peace and stability in southeastern Europe, and the right of all people living in the region to return to their homes and enjoy the benefits of democratic institutions, as well as to know the fate of missing relatives and friends; and enhance its engagement in the Western Balkans region. Recognizes the achievement of the International Commission for Missing Persons in accounting for those missing in conflicts or natural disasters around the world.

 Supports the permanent global role that the Commission will play starting this year in The Hague.

Welcomes the arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia of all persons indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, particularly those of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.

 Commends the cooperation between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to bring those accused persons to justice.

 Asserts that it is in the U.S. national interest that those individuals who are responsible for these crimes should continue to be held accountable for their actions.

Honors the thousands of innocent people killed or executed at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995, along with all individuals who were victimized during the conflict and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, as well as the foreign nationals who risked and in some cases lost their lives during their defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</summary>
