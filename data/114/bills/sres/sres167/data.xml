  <summary date="2015-05-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Offers condolences to the family of Argentinian prosecutor Alberto Nisman.

 Recognizes Mr. Nisman's courageous work in dedicating his life to the investigation of the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which killed 85 people and wounded more than 300.

Calls for a swift, transparent, and internationally backed investigation into Mr. Nisman's death, and encourages the public release of the investigation's results.

Urges the President to offer technical assistance to the government of Argentina in solving Mr. Nisman's death, as well as the ongoing investigation of the AMIA bombing.

Expresses serious concern about: (1) Iran's terrorist network in Argentina, the United States, and all of the Western Hemisphere; and (2) attempts by President Cristina Kirchner and her government to discredit Mr. Nisman and raise unfounded hypotheses on Mr. Nisman's findings and death.

Urges the President to to monitor Iran's activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, as is mandated by the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012.</summary>
