  <summary date="2015-05-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Finds that North Korea: (1) represents a serious threat to the national security of the United States and its allies in East Asia, and to international peace and stability; and (2) violates the human rights of its own people.

 Urges the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury to impose additional sanctions against North Korea, targeting its financial assets and its redesignation as a state sponsor of terror.

Warns the President against resuming negotiations with North Korea, either bilaterally or as part of the Six Party talks, without strict pre-conditions, including that North Korea: (1) adhere to its denuclearization commitments outlined in the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party talks, (2) commit to halting its ballistic missile and proliferation activities, (3) cease military provocations, and (4) improve its human rights record.</summary>
