Honors the centennial of the United States Grain Standards Act by reaffirming the significance of the Act. Finds that the Act remains necessary to facilitate the movement of U.S. grain into the marketplace by providing an internationally recognized standard in sampling, inspection, process verification, weighing, and stowage examination services that accurately and consistently describe the quality and quantity of grain commodities traded domestically and internationally.</summary>
