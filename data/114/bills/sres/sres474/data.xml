Establishes a point of order in the Senate against considering legislation that includes unauthorized appropriations. Permits the point of order to be raised against a provision making an appropriation that: (1) is not made to carry out the provisions of some existing law, treaty stipulation, or act or resolution previously passed by the Senate during that session; or (2) is made to carry out a program, project, or activity for which an authorization of appropriations is not in effect.

Permits the point of order to be waived or suspended in the Senate by a vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes). Requires congressional committees to identify and publicly disclose each unauthorized appropriation that is included in reported legislation.</summary>
