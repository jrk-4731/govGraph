Designates July 30, 2015, as National Whistleblower Appreciation Day.

Encourages each executive agency to recognize such Day by: (1) informing employees, contractors working on behalf of U.S. taxpayers, and members of the public about the legal rights of U.S. citizens to report misconduct, fraud, misdemeanors, or other crimes to the appropriate authorities; and (2) acknowledging the contributions of whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud, abuse, and violations of U.S. laws and regulations.</summary>
