  <summary date="2015-10-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Condemns the 1965-1966 mass murder in Indonesia, and expresses concern about the lack of accountability enjoyed by those who carried out such crimes.

Urges Indonesian political leaders to consider a truth, justice, and reconciliation commission to address alleged crimes against humanity and other human rights violations.

Calls on the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and others involved in developing and implementing policy towards Indonesia during such time period to establish an interagency working group to:

 locate, recommend for declassification, and make available to the public all classified records and documents concerning such mass killings, including records and documents pertaining to covert operations in Indonesia from January 1, 1964, through March 30, 1966; coordinate with federal agencies and take such actions as necessary to expedite the public release of such records; and submit a related report to Congress.</summary>
