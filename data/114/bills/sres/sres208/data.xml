  <summary date="2015-06-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Opposes the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC-EP)'s requested release of Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda (Simon Trinidad), who was convicted by a U.S. jury of plotting to hold three U.S. nationals hostage after they were captured in Colombia and was sentenced to 60 years in prison.

 Extends sympathies to family members of the victims of FARC-EP atrocities.

Recognizes that this type of action would send a negative message to terrorist groups and undermines the U.S. judicial system.</summary>
