  <summary date="2016-03-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Rejects the ``Plan to Close Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility,'' presented by the President on February 23, 2016, to transfer, release, or assist in the transfer or release to the U.S. homeland of detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Determines that any attempt by the President to undertake such release or transfer is in direct violation of specified public laws.

Finds that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is the optimal location to house dangerous foreign enemy combatants and should not be closed.

Asserts that any potential transfer or release to the U.S. homeland of Guantanamo detainees represents a national security threat due to the risk of providing law of war detainees with constitutional rights and protections, including the potential for release into the United States, and, particularly, a threat to the security of local communities in Kansas, Colorado, and South Carolina.

Demands that the President abandon any plans to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. homeland without explicit congressional authorization.</summary>
