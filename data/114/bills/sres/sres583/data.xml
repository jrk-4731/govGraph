  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Amends Rule XXXI (Executive Session - Proceedings on Nominations) of the Standing Rules of the Senate to require the Senate, within 180 days after a judicial nomination made by the President is received, to vote on: (1) whether the Senate will advise and consent to the nomination, or (2) a motion to invoke cloture on it.

Prescribes procedures for consideration of the nomination if the Senate fails, within such period, to vote on such nomination or the cloture motion.

Exempts from this requirement a judicial nomination if, before the end of such period, the committee to which the nomination has been referred, votes to report it unfavorably.</summary>
