  <summary date="2015-12-08T14:16:52Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Commemorates World Press Freedom Day by commending journalists like Mazen Darwish and others around the world for the vital role they play in supporting democratic societies, promoting government accountability, and strengthening civil society.

Expresses concern about the threats to freedom of the press and expression around the world, and pays tribute to journalists who have lost their lives carrying out their work.

Calls on governments abroad to implement United Nations General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/68/163) by investigating and seeking to resolve outstanding cases of violence against journalists.

Condemns actions around the world that suppress freedom of the press, including the murders of journalists by the terrorist group ISIS, attacks against media outlets like the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, and kidnappings of journalists and media workers in eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian militant groups.

Reaffirms the centrality of freedom of the press to U.S. efforts to support democracy and mitigate conflict.

Calls on the President and the Department of State to: (1) improve the means by which the United States responds to threats against freedom of the press around the world, (2) urge foreign governments to investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of attacks against journalists, and (3) highlight the issue of threats against freedom of the press.</summary>
