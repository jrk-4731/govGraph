The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses the sense of the Senate that:\n\n all sides to the current conflict in Yemen should abide by international obligations to protect civilians, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief throughout the country, and respect negotiated cease-fires and work toward a lasting political settlement; U.S.-supported Saudi military operations in Yemen should take all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and civilian objects, and should increase prioritization of targeting of designated foreign terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and affiliates of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; the Houthi-Saleh forces engaged in the conflict in Yemen should cease indiscriminate shelling of areas inhabited by civilians and should allow free access by humanitarian relief organizations seeking to deliver aid to civilian populations under siege; and a reconstruction and stabilization plan should be developed alongside a negotiated political framework, in consultation with local stakeholders and with robust financing from the international community, including Gulf Cooperation Council countries that have previously made pledges to fund Yemen's post-conflict reconstruction."
