  <summary date="2016-12-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should: (1) ensure the affordability and feasibility of the Department of Defense and Department of Energy plan for modernizing U.S. nuclear weapons by reevaluating and modifying proposals for programs to modernize such weapons and their delivery systems to ensure that such proposals focus on refurbishment to ensure security, safety, and efficiency of existing weapons and delivery systems; and (2) prioritize planned programs so that the United States retains a nuclear arsenal robust enough to meet deterrence needs and so that such programs do not jeopardize other economic investments and security expenditures appropriate to U.S. needs in the 21st century.</summary>
