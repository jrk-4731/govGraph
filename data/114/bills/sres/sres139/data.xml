Sends best wishes to the families, friends, and neighbors of the 168 people killed in the April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Expresses gratitude for the recovery of those injured in the bombing.

Thanks the first responders, rescue workers, medical personnel, and volunteers who answered the call for help that morning and in the weeks that followed.

Declares that the Senate, on the 20th anniversary of that day, resolves to work with the people of the United States to promote the goals and mission established by the Oklahoma City National Memorial.

Commends the people of Oklahoma City for their progress over the past two decades, for demonstrating their commitment to the ability of hope to triumph over violence, and for their perseverance in standing for the strength of goodness in overcoming evil.</summary>
