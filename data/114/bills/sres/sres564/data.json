Calls on: (1) such regime to unconditionally abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programs, and (2) China to exercise its leverage to halt such programs.\n\nReaffirms the U.S. commitment to defending allies in the region, including through deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to South Korea and through joint U.S.-Japan efforts to develop the next generation of missile defense interceptors. Reinforces longstanding U.S. commitments to provide extended deterrence to South Korea and Japan.\n\nExpresses support for ongoing efforts to strengthen the U.S.-South Korea alliance, to defend the alliance against provocations by North Korea, and to protect U.S. Armed Forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nCalls on all Security Council members to pass new measures under Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, including:\n\n stricter measures to eliminate exceptions in current Security Council resolution sanctions; further restrictions on imports and exports of such sectoral commodities as coal, iron, and precious metals and the prohibition on fuel oil exports to North Korea; elimination of access to international financial markets and banking for entities involved in North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs; restrictions on the use of North Korean subcontractors in global supply chains; restrictions on the supply of aviation fuel and a ban on civilian aviation; a ban on bulk cash transfers to and from North Korea; prevention of the use of North Korean labor in third-country projects and agreements; and a downgrading of North Korean diplomatic representation."
