 Calls on the United States, its European allies, and the international community to continue to apply economic and other pressure on the Russian Federation, especially sanctions, if the Russian Federation continues to refuse to cease its aggression in Ukraine.

 Calls on the Russian Federation to end its support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine, allow Ukraine to regain control of its internationally-recognized borders, and withdraw its military presence in eastern Ukraine.

 Expresses solidarity with the people of Ukraine regarding the humanitarian crisis in their country and the destruction caused by the Russian Federation's military, financial, and ideological support for the rebels in eastern Ukraine.
