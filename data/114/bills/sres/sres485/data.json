    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on July 14, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nExpresses concern with respect to the failure of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to take actions required to hold elections in November 2016 as required by its Constitution.\n\nRecognizes that impunity and lack of effective rule of law undermine democracy and that the arrest and detention of civil society activists and the harassment of political opponents close political space and repress peaceful dissent.\n\nReaffirms support for democracy and good governance in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCalls on the DRC government and all other parties to respect the Constitution of the DRC and ensure a free, open, peaceful, and democratic transition of power. Urges such government to demonstrate leadership and commitment to elections by accelerating concrete steps towards holding elections, including registering voters and protecting partisan political speech and activities.\n\nEncourages such government and all other relevant parties to engage in a focused discussion to advance the electoral process and reach consensus on the way forward by establishing a detailed electoral calendar for all elections and enabling the candidate selection and campaign process.\n\nUrges the President of the United States, in close coordination with regional and international partners, to:\n\n continuously verify that such necessary technical dialogue occurs and proceeds in a time and manner required to ensure the conduct of timely elections; use appropriate means to ensure the objectives of this resolution, which may include imposition of additional targeted sanctions on individuals or entities responsible for violence and human rights violations and undermining democratic processes in the DRC; and continue U.S. policy with respect to providing support for the organizing of free, fair, and peaceful national elections."
