  <summary date="2016-01-20T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Opposes: (1) the European Commission interpretive notice regarding labeling Israeli products and goods manufactured in the West Bank and other areas; and (2) politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israel or Israeli-controlled territory.

 Calls upon the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament to oppose boycott, divestment, or sanctions initiatives aimed at singling out Israel, and to refrain from actions counterproductive to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Encourages European Union (EU) member states to exert prudence in the implementation of the EU labeling guidelines regarding Israeli products and goods manufactured in the West Bank and other areas.

Urges the Administration to increase its influence in international forums to oppose boycott, divestment, and sanctions actions against Israel.

Supports efforts by U.S. state legislatures to enact measures that oppose such acts against Israel.

Reaffirms support for a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</summary>
