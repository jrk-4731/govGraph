  <summary date="2016-02-11T13:13:45Z" status="Passed Senate amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on February 10, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Recognizes that Robert Levinson is the longest held U.S. civilian in our nation's history.

 Notes the repeated pledges by and renewed commitment of Iranian officials to provide their government's assistance in the Robert Levinson case.

 Urges the government of Iran, as a humanitarian gesture, to act on its promises to assist in Robert Levinson's case and to provide all information from all entities of the government of Iran regarding Robert Levinson's disappearance to the U.S. government.

 Urges the President and U.S. allies to continue to raise the Robert Levinson case with Iranian officials at every opportunity, notwithstanding the disagreements the United States has with Iran on a broad array of issues, including Iran's ballistic missile program, sponsorship of international terrorism, and human rights abuses.

 Expresses sympathy to Robert Levinson's family for their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be brought to an end in the near future.</summary>
