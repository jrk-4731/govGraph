  <summary date="2016-06-16T14:00:07Z" status="Reported to Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses the sense of the Senate that:

 gains made in border security in the Border Patrol's Yuma Sector and positive trends in recidivism rates are of critical importance to those living and working in the border region and to the nation; refusing to prosecute first time illegal border crossers will jeopardize those gains and the executive branch should remove any policy or direction to cease prosecuting first time illegal border crossers under Operation Streamline; the border security steps that have led to some measure of improvement on the border, such as the historical implementation of Operation Streamline, should be preserved.</summary>
