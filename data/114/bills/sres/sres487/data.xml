Expresses the sense of the Senate that:

 the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) continues to train the next generation of military leaders, who are well equipped to defeat enemies of the United States; the Senate is encouraged by the quality of leaders that Army ROTC has and will continue to produce; and the Army ROTC produces more Army officers than any other source.</summary>
