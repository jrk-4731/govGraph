  <summary date="2016-05-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Condemns: (1) actions by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to subvert the Constitution of the DRC and undermine democracy, (2) the failure of such government to take timely necessary measures to organize free and fair national elections, and (3) violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by its security forces.

Reaffirms support for democracy and good-governance in sub-Saharan Africa that are free from political repression and human rights abuses.

Calls on President Kabila's government to: (1) publicly and unequivocally commit to complete a peaceful transfer of presidential power upon the expiration of his mandate on December 19, 2016, and (2) adhere to the DRC Constitution and relinquish power at the end of his term.

Calls on the President of the United States: (1) in coordination with regional and international partners and the United Nations, to impose targeted sanctions on those DRC officials responsible for violence and human rights violations and undermining democratic processes or institutions; and (2) to consider lifting sanctions when specified conditions apply, including that a free and fair presidential election has been held in the DRC and a new President has been sworn into office.

Calls on the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to review all U.S. assistance to the DRC to ensure that such assistance is not being used to support President Kabila's efforts to remain in power.

Calls on the Department of State and USAID to: (1) continue providing financial and technical assistance to support the organizing of free, fair, and peaceful national elections and the inclusion and civic education of youth, women, and rural populations; and (2) ensure the continuance of U.S. assistance delivered through nongovernmental organizations.</summary>
