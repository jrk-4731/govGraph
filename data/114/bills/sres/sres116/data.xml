  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Endorses specified prerequisites for free and fair general elections in Burma.

Calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to:

 support efforts to reform the 2008 Constitution of Burma in a manner that promotes democratic development and safeguards against military interference; support free and fair elections in Burma; express solidarity with the United Nations special mechanisms that are investigating violations of human rights violations in Burma, and concern regarding the government of Burma's refusal to work with such mechanisms; and ensure that ethnic groups in Burma are not coerced into cease fire agreements with the government of Burma. Calls upon the United States, in partnership with other international donors, to ensure that Burma and the Union Election Commission function independently and impartially throughout the election period.

Expects the President to: (1) delay further steps toward normalization of relations with the government of Burma should it undermine the prospects for free and fair elections, and (2) sanction individuals in the government of Burma who the President determines undermine free and fair elections.

Calls upon the Secretary to publicly condemn human rights abuses committed by the military and to demand credible and independent investigations and prosecutions of all allegations of such abuse.</summary>
