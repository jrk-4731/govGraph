  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Honors the courage of Guillermo "El Coco" Farinas in standing up to the repression of the government of Cuba. Recognizes Farinas for his perseverance in seeking meaningful change through peaceful means.

Acknowledges that the efforts of such government to undermine his latest hunger strike through the release of a fabricated report failed to diminish the international attention that his hunger strike attracted to the human rights situation in Cuba.

Expresses solidarity and support for Farinas, his efforts, and his commitment to basic human freedoms for the Cuban people.</summary>
