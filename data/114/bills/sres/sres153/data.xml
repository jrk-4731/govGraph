Reaffirms the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, including through U.S. extended deterrence, the revision of the Guidelines for United States-Japan Defense Cooperation, and Japan's policy of Proactive Contribution to Peace based on the principles of international cooperation.

Reaffirms that the United States remains committed under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security to respond to any armed attack in the territories under Japan's administration.

 Recognizes Japan's support in addressing global challenges that threaten the security of people everywhere.

Supports U.S.-Japan academic, scientific, technical, and cultural exchanges.

Promotes U.S.-Japan economic and trade ties, including the empowerment of women.
