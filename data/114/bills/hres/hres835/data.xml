 develop a national policy to encourage the development of tools for consumers to learn and protect their assets in a way that maximizes the promise customized, connected devices hold to empower consumers, foster future economic growth, and create new commerce and markets; prioritize accelerating the development of alternative technologies that support transparency, security, and authentication in a way that recognizes their benefits, allows for future innovation, and responsibly protects consumers' personal information; recognize that technology experts can play an important role in the future development of consumer-facing technology applications for manufacturing, automobiles, telecommunications, tourism, health care, energy, and general commerce; and support further innovation and economic growth and ensure cybersecurity and the protection of consumer privacy. Calls for innovators in technology, manufacturing, automobiles, telecommunications, tourism, health care, and energy industries to commit to improving the quality of life for future generations by developing new technology that is safe and consumer protective and that is aimed at improving consumers' access to commerce.</summary>
