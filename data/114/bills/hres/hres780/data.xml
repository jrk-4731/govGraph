  <summary date="2016-11-15T13:40:28Z" status="Passed House amended">The United States should impose sanctions on government officials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who impede progress toward a democratic transition through credible elections that respect the will of the DRC people.

Sanctions should target core figures in President Kabila's government for visa denials and asset freezes.

Economic and security assistance should be reviewed for possible termination, while preserving humanitarian assistance, until the election crisis is resolved.

The President of the United States should lift sanctions only when: (1) President Kabila has declared that he will not remain in power once his term ends and has made verifiable progress towards holding national elections, or (2) the DRC has held a free and fair presidential election and a new President has been sworn in.

The United States should: (1) support independent DRC civil society organizations and media, and (2) investigate and target money laundering activities by key figures close to President Kabila and those financial institutions involved in such activities.

The United States should coordinate efforts with key Western and African partners, including through other financial intelligence units.</summary>
