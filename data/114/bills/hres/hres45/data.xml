  <summary date="2015-01-22T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends Rule XIII (the Members, Delegates, and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require each committee report on a public bill or joint resolution to contain:

 an analysis by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of whether the measure creates any new federal program, office, or initiative that would duplicate or overlap with any existing federal entity with similar mission, purpose, goals, or activities, along with a listing of all the instances of duplication or overlapping; and if the analysis indicates that the new program, office, or initiative would create duplication or overlapping, the committee's explanation as to why such creation is necessary. Makes it out of order in the House to consider a committee report on such legislation unless the committee has posted on its website the analysis and (if necessary) the explanation.</summary>
