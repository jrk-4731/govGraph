  <summary date="2015-04-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses commitment to strengthening the quality of care and expanding support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their family caregivers.

Declares that: (1) achieving the primary goal of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025 is an urgent national priority, and (2) bold action and considerable increases in funding are necessary to meet that goal.

Encourages: (1) greater collaboration between governments to advance a global Alzheimer's and dementia research plan; (2) innovative public-private partnerships, financing tools, incentives, and other mechanisms to accelerate the pursuit of disease-modifying therapies.

 Calls for: (1) significantly increasing the funding for Alzheimer's research in FY2016; and (2) developing a plan for FY2017-FY2020 to meet the target of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for the United States to spend $2 billion each year on Alzheimer's research.</summary>
