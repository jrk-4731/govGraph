  <summary date="2016-07-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Resolves that John Andrew Koskinen, Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that specified articles of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate.

Sets forth articles of impeachment specifying that John Andrew Koskinen, in his conduct while Commissioner of the IRS:

 engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an officer of the United States by failing to respond to lawfully issued congressional subpoenas, engaged in a pattern of deception that demonstrates his unfitness to serve by making a series of false and misleading statements to Congress in contravention of his oath to tell the truth, acted in a manner inconsistent with the trust and confidence placed in him as an officer of the United States, and failed to act with competence and forthrightness in overseeing the investigation into IRS targeting of Americans because of their political affiliations.</summary>
