Directs the House of Representatives to bring a civil action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy to:

 exercise prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals who came to the United States as children, as announced by DHS on June 15, 2012; or exercise further prosecutorial discretion with respect to certain other unlawfully present aliens, as directed in a November 20, 2014, memorandum and related executive branch memoranda. Declares that:

 any amounts obligated or expended by the House to carry out this resolution shall be derived from existing appropriations for House salaries and expenses, and nothing in this resolution may be construed as authorizing an increase of House budget authority; and nothing in this resolution may be construed to affect the Speaker's authority to initiate, or intervene in, any civil action on behalf of the House.</summary>
