 Recognizes that the movement to end the Vietnam War was one of the largest and most prolonged efforts to achieve peace in recent generations and was critical to bringing an end to the war.

 Applauds the establishment of higher educational programs that are focused on conflict transformation and peace building.

 Urges continued efforts to reflect on the Vietnam War's lessons and to recommit to sustained diplomacy that prevents conflict.</summary>
