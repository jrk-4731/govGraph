  <summary date="2015-07-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that the House of Representatives: (1)&#160;disagrees with the Supreme Court's&#160;majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges and its holdings that the&#160;Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution requires states to license marriages between same-sex couples and requires states to recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state; and (2) agrees with the four dissenting opinions, which uphold the traditional definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman and the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Expresses the sense of the House that:

 the traditional definition of marriage is a union between one man and one woman; the majority opinion in Obergefell unconstitutionally and indefensibly distorts the definition of marriage; states may refuse to be bound by the holding in Obergefell; states are not required to license same-sex marriage or recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states; and &#160;individuals, businesses, churches, religious groups, and other faith-based organizations are encouraged, empowered, and protected to exercise their faith without fear of legal or government interference.</summary>
