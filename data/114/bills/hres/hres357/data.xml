  <summary date="2015-07-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that:

 Congress should establish a federal reapportionment system that would create compact and contiguous congressional districts that, to the greatest extent possible, follow geographic boundaries and county lines; congressional districts should not favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party; congressional districts should adhere to the existing standards of equal population; and the highest court of each state should have the power to reject congressional district maps that do not meet the above criteria.</summary>
