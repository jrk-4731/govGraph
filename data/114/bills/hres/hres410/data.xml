  <summary date="2015-09-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">States that:

 the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, commonly referred to as the Corker-Cardin bill, does not apply to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran because the JCPOA is fundamentally different from the agreement as represented to Congress by the Administration and the Corker-Cardin bill is only applicable to an agreement that is not a treaty; Article II of the U.S. Constitution declares that the President shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, but only if two-thirds of the Senators present concur; the JCPOA is a treaty and, pursuant to Article II, the Senate must give its advice and consent to ratification if the JCPOA is to be effective and binding upon the United States; and not later than 30 days after the date of the adoption of this resolution, the Senate should schedule and consider a resolution of ratification with respect to the JCPOA.</summary>
