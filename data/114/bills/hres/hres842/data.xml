 Recognizes September 11 as a day of solemn commemoration. Extends deepest sympathies to the innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and their families, friends, and loved ones. Honors the heroism and sacrifices of U.S. military and civilian personnel and their families in defense of their country. Credits the heroism of first responders, law enforcement personnel, state and local officials, volunteers, and others who aided the victims of the attacks. Thanks the leaders and citizens of nations who have assisted and continue to stand in solidarity with the United States against terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks. Commends the military and intelligence personnel involved in the removal of Osama bin Laden.

Reasserts a commitment to opposing violent extremism against American interests and to providing the U.S. military, intelligence, and law enforcement communities with the resources and support to do so. Vows to continue to identify, intercept, and disrupt terrorists and their activities.

Reaffirms that the American people will never forget the sacrifices made on September 11, 2001, or bow to terrorist demands. Declares that Congress stands adjourned out of respect to the victims of the attacks.</summary>
