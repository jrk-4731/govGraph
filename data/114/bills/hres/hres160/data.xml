  <summary date="2015-03-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Welcomes the Seventh Summit of the Americas to be held in Panama City, Panama, April 10, 2015, and April 11, 2015.

 Believes that the Summit will: (1) be an important multilateral forum for heads of state in the Western Hemisphere to discuss common policy issues and set policy goals, and (2) provide a forum for the United States to advance its interests in the region.

Encourages all countries in the Western Hemisphere to commit to democratic governance, free and open markets, and basic human rights and to uphold the principles enshrined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.

Urges heads of state to provide opportunities for all civil society organizations to provide input during events surrounding the Summit.</summary>
