The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nKnife Owners' Protection Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill permits an individual to transport a knife between two states where knife possession, carry, or transport is legal. A knife must be securely stored during transport.\n\nSpecifically, a knife transported by motor vehicle must be inaccessible from the vehicle's passenger compartment or secured in a closed container, glove compartment, or console in a vehicle with no separate passenger compartment. A knife transported by other means (e.g., air) must be secured in a closed container.\n\nAn emergency knife designed to cut seat belts is exempt from the requirement to be securely stored during interstate transport.\n\nThis bill prohibits the arrest or detention of an individual for a knife violation unless there is probable cause to believe the individual failed to securely store the knife during transport. An individual may assert compliance with this Act as a claim or defense in any civil or criminal action or proceeding."
