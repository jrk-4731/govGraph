Permits a health insurance issuer that had in effect health insurance coverage in the group market on any date during 2013 to continue offering that coverage through 2018 outside of a health care exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Treats that coverage as a grandfathered health plan for purposes of an individual meeting the requirement to maintain minimum essential health coverage.</summary>
