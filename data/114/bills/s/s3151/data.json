Labor must provide funding to the boards to assist with training adults and disadvantaged youths, including providing services to promote literacy, attain education, and assist with job search and placement.Additionally, Labor must provide funding to states to carry out vocational rehabilitation and referral services for individuals with disabilities so that those individuals may prepare for and engage in employment.\n\nThe bill also provides training for Native Americans to develop skills, be competitive in the workforce, and promote economic and social development.\n\nThe bill amends the Second Chance Act of 2007 to make youth offenders eligible to receive grants from Labor for certain transitional services, including being reintegrated into society and obtaining and retaining employment.\n\nThe bill replaces several provisions related to educational and employment programs for adults, youths, disabled individuals, and Native Americans."
