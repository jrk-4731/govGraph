 Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to declare that any regulation, order, or other action of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that requires a bank holding company to provide funds or other assets to a subsidiary depository institution shall not be effective nor enforceable with respect to an entity that is a savings and loan holding company that is also an insurance company, an affiliate of an insured depository institution that is an insurance company, or any other company that is an insurance company and that directly or indirectly controls an insured depository institution if: (1) such funds or assets are to be provided by the entity, and (2) the state insurance authority for the insurance company determines that such an action would have a materially adverse effect on the entity's financial condition.Declares that requiring a bank holding company that is an insurance company or such an entity to serve as a source of financial strength shall be deemed the kind of action of the Board to which this Act applies.

Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, with respect to systemic risk determination and the treatment of insurance companies and their subsidiaries, to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to stand in the place of the appropriate regulatory agency and file a judicial action to place such companies into orderly rehabilitation under state law if the appropriate regulatory agency has not done so.

Requires the FDIC, when funding the orderly liquidation of an insurance company or its subsidiary, to notify the relevant state insurance authority promptly of its intention to take a lien on the company's assets.

Prohibits the FDIC from taking such a lien if the state insurance authority informs it that doing so would have a materially adverse effect upon the insurance company's policyholders.</summary>
