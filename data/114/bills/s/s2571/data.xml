This bill bars the Department of Transportation from disapproving an airport development project grant application just because the airport enters into or renews a lease for the use, at a nominal rate, of airport property by a regular or reserve component of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard, without regard to whether that component operates aircraft at the airport.</summary>
