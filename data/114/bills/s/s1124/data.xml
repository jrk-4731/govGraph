WIOA Technical Amendments Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) to revise requirements for local workforce development areas involved in statewide workforce investment activities as well as youth, adult, and dislocated worker employment and training activities.

The governor of a state may approve a request for local workforce development area designation of any area served by a rural concentrated employment program.

Local workforce development boards requirements are revised.

A state may use as an alternative workforce development board only a local entity (including a local council, regional workforce development board, or similar entity) that was in existence the day before enactment of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Currently such an alternative local entity is eligible for designation as a local workforce development board if it has been in existence as late as the day before the enactment of the WIOA on July 22, 2014.

Certain technical amendments are made to performance accountability requirements for statewide and local workforce investment programs.

The Department of Labor shall ensure that states receive an allotment for a fiscal year for adult employment and training activities and for dislocated worker employment and training activities and statewide workforce investment activities equal to at least 90% of the state's allotment for the preceding fiscal year.

(Sec. 3) This bill also amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 with respect to the terms of service requirements for members of the National Council on Disability, making them (unchanged in detail) effective only as of July 21, 2014.</summary>
