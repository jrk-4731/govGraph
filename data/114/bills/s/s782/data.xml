Grand Canyon Bison Management Act

(Sec. 3) This bill directs the Department of the Interior to publish a management plan to reduce, through humane lethal culling by skilled public volunteers and other nonlethal means, the population of bison in the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona that Interior determines are detrimental to the uses of the Park.

 Such a volunteer may remove a full bison harvested from the Park.

 Interior shall coordinate with the Arizona Game and Fish Commission regarding the development and implementation of the management plan.

 In developing such plan, Interior must comply with all applicable federal environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.</summary>
