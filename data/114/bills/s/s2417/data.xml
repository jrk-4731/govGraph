Tribal Veterans Health Care Enhancement Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to allow the Indian Health Service (IHS) to pay copayments owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by Indian veterans for services authorized under the Purchased/Referred Care program.

The IHS and the VA, in consultation with impacted Indian tribes, must enter into a memorandum of understanding that authorizes the IHS to pay such copayments unless it would decrease the quality of, or access to, health care for individuals receiving care from the IHS or the VA.

The IHS and the VA must report on veterans who are IHS beneficiaries and have received care from the VA.</summary>
