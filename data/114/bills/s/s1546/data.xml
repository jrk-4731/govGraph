This bill declares that it is the policy of this Act:

 that, should the statutory authority for the export loan programs administered by the Export-Import Bank of the United States lapse, the Small Business Administration (SBA) shall serve the Bank's small business clients under existing statutory authority of the Small Business Act; to create an SBA Export Credit Insurance Program similar to the Bank's; and to ensure that small business exporters are served by SBA programs. The bill also amends the Small Business Act to require the SBA to establish a program to provide insurance for the exports of small businesses, including insurance against nonpayment by international buyers.</summary>
