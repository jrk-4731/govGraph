Upon request, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must meet with the sponsor of such a medication to discuss the plan for pediatric studies.\n\nThe FDA may require the sponsor of an approved medication that could be used to treat pediatric cancer to complete a pediatric assessment if: (1) the medication is used for a substantial number of pediatric cancer patients, or (2) there is reason to believe the medication would have a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric cancer patients.\n\nThe bill limits waivers of pediatric assessment requirements for certain medications that could be used to treat a pediatric cancer for which there is a need for additional treatment options.\n\nThe FDA must meet with medication sponsors to discuss a deferral or waiver of the pediatric assessment requirement."
