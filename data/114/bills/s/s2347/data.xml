  <summary date="2015-12-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Foreclosure Relief and Extension for Servicemembers Act of 2015

This bill amends the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 to extend through 2016 the one-year period after a service member's military service during which: (1) a court may stay proceedings to enforce an obligation on real or personal property owned by the service member before such military service; and (2) any sale, foreclosure, or seizure of such property shall be invalid without a court order or waiver agreement signed by the service member. (Currently, the extended one-year period is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2015, and return to a nine-month period under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.)

Effective January 1, 2017 (currently, January 1, 2016), the old nine-month period in place of the one-year period granted by such Act shall be restored.</summary>
