This bill amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to authorize federal agencies to enter into energy savings performance contracts to reduce the costs of fuel supply, delivery, or transport for nonbuilding applications. Payments by agencies to entities that supply, deliver, or transport fuel under such contracts may not exceed the amounts the agencies would have paid entities without the contracts.</summary>
