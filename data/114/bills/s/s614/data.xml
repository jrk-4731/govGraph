Federal Improper Payments Coordination Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Amends the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 to extend the availability of the Do Not Pay Initiative to states, any contractor, subcontractor, or agent of a state, and the judicial and legislative branches of the United States. Authorizes the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance for establishing privacy and other requirements for incorporation into Do Not Pay Initiative access agreements with states and judicial and legislative branches.

(Sec. 3) Modifies such Act to require each federal agency to review the death records maintained by the Social Security Administration (SSA) (currently, the Death Master File of SSA).

Directs the Departments of Defense and State to establish a procedure for submitting information on the deaths of individuals to federal agencies promptly and on a regular basis.

Requires the OMB and the heads of other relevant governmental entities to issue guidance on the implementation of the Do Not Pay Initiative to the Department of the Treasury and each agency and component of an agency: (1) that operates or maintains a database of information; or (2) for which the OMB determines improved data matching would be relevant, necessary, or beneficial.

(Sec. 4) Directs Treasury to submit a report to Congress that describes: (1) data analytics performed as part of the Do Not Pay Business Center operated by Treasury, (2) metrics used in determining whether analytic and investigatory efforts have reduced improper payments or awards, and (3) the target dates for implementing the data analytics operations.</summary>
