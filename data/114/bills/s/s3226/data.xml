This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish and maintain the Enewetak Atoll Veterans Health Registry of each veteran who performed a radiation cleanup mission in the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands between January 1, 1977, and December 31, 1980, while serving as a member of the Armed Forces and who:

 applies for medical care or services from the VA; files a claim for compensation on the basis of any disability associated with such service; dies and is survived by a spouse, child, or parent who files a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation on the basis of such service; requests a health examination from the VA; or receives such a health examination and submits a request to be included in the registry. The registry shall include relevant medical data relating to the health status of each such individual who: (1) grants the VA permission to include such information, or (2) is deceased when the individual's name is added to the registry.

In the case of such an individual who is deceased, the VA shall provide that individual's spouse, child, or parent with consultation and counseling with respect to the results of an examination of such individual, upon request.

The VA shall: (1) periodically notify individuals listed in the registry of significant developments in research on the health consequences of potential radiation exposure related to such service, (2) provide for an independent study on such potential exposure, and (3) carry out outreach activities with respect to health examinations and consultation and counseling services.</summary>
