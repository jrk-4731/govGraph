 (Sec. 2) This bill revises the railroad safety risk reduction program.

The bill extends from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2020, the deadline for submission to the Department of Transportation (DOT) by each Class I railroad carrier and each entity providing regularly scheduled intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation of a plan for implementing a positive train control (PTC) system on certain of its tracks.

(Sec. 3) DOT may extend the implementation deadline, upon application, in one-year increments, if specified circumstances exist.

(Sec. 4) The bill directs DOT to revise federal regulations requiring a Class II or III railroad (including a tourist or excursion railroad) to extend by five years the deadlines for equipping its locomotives with an onboard PTC system to operate in PTC territory and applicable reporting requirements.

(Sec. 5) The bill requires Class I railroad carriers and each entity providing regularly scheduled intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation to submit annual progress reports to DOT on the status of plans to implement a PTC system.</summary>
