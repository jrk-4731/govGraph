Investments must focus on expanding: (1) the number of people with new access to Internet services; (2) construction of fiber, mobile, and other emerging access technologies; (3) rural area Internet access hubs; (4) the capacity of developing countries to monitor and regulate the Internet sector and encourage private investment; and (5) investment priorities in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions with acute shortages of critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to: (1) allow OPIC to make loans for projects sponsored by, or significantly involving, U.S. investors or foreign associations with U.S. owners; (2) require systems infrastructure costs to be treated as transaction costs; and (3) extend until 2021 OPIC's authority to issue investment insurance, investment guarantees, and direct loans.\n\nThe President must report annually on a multiyear strategy encouraging developing countries to expand Internet access as a means to catalyze innovation and economic growth, promote democracy, create educational opportunities, improve health outcomes, and strengthen global research networks.\n\nThe President may establish an Interagency Working Group to coordinate U.S. government activities in carrying out the strategy."
