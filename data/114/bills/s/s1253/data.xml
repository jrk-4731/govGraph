(Sec. 2) This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to make a separate payment, calculated according to a specified formula, to a home health agency for an applicable disposable device when furnished on or after January 1, 2017 to an individual who receives home health services for which payment is made under Medicare.

 An "applicable disposable device" is one that is:

 a disposable negative pressure wound therapy device that is an integrated system composed of a non-manual vacuum pump, a receptacle for collecting exudate, and dressings for the purposes of wound therapy; and a substitute for, and used in lieu of, a negative pressure wound therapy durable medical equipment item that is an integrated system of a negative pressure vacuum pump, a separate exudate collection canister, and dressings that would otherwise be covered for individuals for such wound therapy. The Government Accountability Office shall study:

 the value of disposable devices to the Medicare program and Medicare beneficiaries as well as the role of disposable devices as substitutes for durable medical equipment, and the impact of the payment under this Act for applicable disposable devices.</summary>
