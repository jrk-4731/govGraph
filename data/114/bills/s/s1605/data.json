(Sec. 4) The bill provides that a country qualifying for candidate status as an eligible country with a per capita income that changes in the fiscal year such that the country would be reclassified from a low income country to a lower middle income country, or from a lower middle income country to a low income country, shall retain its candidacy status in its former income classification for such fiscal year and the two subsequent fiscal years.\n\n(Sec. 5) A member of the corporation's board who is not a federal officer may continue to serve in each initial or additional appointment for up to one year until his or her successor is appointed.\n\n(Sec. 6) The board, after entering into a compact, shall publish in the Federal Register a notice that the compact's summary and text are available on the corporation's Internet website and provide the website's address. (The board is currently required to publish a compact's summary and text in the Federal Register and on the corporation's Internet website.)\n\n(Sec. 7) The bill prohibits assistance for a country that does not qualify as a candidate country for the fiscal year when such assistance is provided. (A candidate country is a country that: (1) satisfies specified low income- and assistance-related requirements; and (2) demonstrates a significant commitment to, but fails to meet, specified political, economic, and social criteria.)\n\n(Sec. 8) Before the board selects an eligible country for a compact, the corporation shall provide the board with information on the country's treatment of civil society.\n\n(Sec. 9) The corporation shall submit a study within 180 days assessing the feasibility of developing partnerships at the subnational level within candidate countries that would be complementary to and concurrent with national or regional investments."
