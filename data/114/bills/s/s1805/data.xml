This bill amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to alter&#160;the formula that school food authorities are required to use to establish the price for a paid lunch (a lunch provided to children who are not eligible for free or reduced price meals). Specifically, the bill makes the formula&#160;applicable only to school food authorities that had a negative balance in their nonprofit school food service account for the previous school year.</summary>
