  <summary date="2016-09-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Mandatory Bureaucratic Realignment and Consolidation Commission Act of 2016 or the Mandatory BRACC Act 

This bill establishes within the legislative branch a Mandatory Bureaucratic Realignment and Consolidation Commission to review all direct spending by the federal government and identify changes in law to reduce direct spending. The commission may also review offsetting receipts and discretionary appropriations.

The commission must submit to Congress a report including recommendations and proposed legislation to reduce direct spending, such that:

 total spending is gradually reduced during FY2018-FY2027, total spending does not exceeded total revenues by FY2027 and for each succeeding year, and direct spending does not exceed 50% of total spending by FY2027 and for each succeeding year. Congress must consider the commission's proposal using specified expedited legislative procedures.

If a bill to achieve the commission's recommendations is not enacted, the President must order a sequestration to enforce specified limits on the growth of spending. A sequestration is not required if: (1) the Office of Management and Budget determines that, as a result of reductions in budgetary resources required by this bill, total spending for the previous year did not exceed revenues; or (2) changes in law have been enacted that will achieve the requirements for the commission's proposal.</summary>
