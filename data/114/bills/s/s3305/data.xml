This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the use of electronic visit verification systems for certain services under the Medicare program. An "electronic visit verification system" is a system under which care-related visits are electronically verified with regard to: (1) the type and date of service, (2) the individual receiving the service, (3) the individual providing the service, (4) the location of service delivery, and (5) the time the service begins and ends.

A home health agency must have such a system in place&#160;for home health services as a condition of participation in the Medicare program.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services shall establish standards for the systems and must consult with agencies to ensure that such standards: (1) are minimally burdensome, (2) account for existing best practices and electronic visit verifications systems already in use, and (3) require that the systems are conducted in accordance with specified legal requirements related to privacy and security.</summary>
