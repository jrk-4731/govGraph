Requires the House of Representatives and the Senate to make publicly available the determinations of each Member of the House of Representatives and each Senator regarding the designation of their employees (including leadership and committee staff) as congressional staff for purposes of requiring those employees to enroll in health insurance coverage offered through a health benefit exchange as required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Requires the absence of designation of an employee as congressional staff to be noted in the determination along with a statement that the absence of that designation permits the employee to remain in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.</summary>
