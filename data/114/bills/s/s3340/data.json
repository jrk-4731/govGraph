The VA must:\n\n establish a policy on the provision of respectful and timely burial of such veterans, ensure that such policy is based on best practices used in the private sector, and balance the interests of the deceased in identifying the deceased's next of kin and in having a timely burial. The VA shall follow state and local government practices with respect to the treatment of unclaimed remains of deceased veterans until it establishes such policy.\n\nThe VA shall report annually regarding the remains of covered veterans who died in the most recently completed calendar year."
