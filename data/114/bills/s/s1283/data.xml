  <summary date="2015-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal: (1) the coal and related technologies program; (2) the carbon capture research, development and demonstration program; and (3) the Clean Coal Power Initiative.

In lieu of those programs the Department of Energy (DOE) shall establish a coal technology program encompassing: (1) research and development, (2) large-scale pilot projects, and (3) demonstration projects.

 DOE must develop performance standards that include:

 ensuring reliable, low cost power from new and existing coal plants; addressing carbon dioxide emissions through high efficiency platforms and carbon capture from new and existing coal plants; support flexible baseload operations for new and existing applications of coal generation; and validate geologic storage of large volumes of anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide and the infrastructure needed to support a carbon dioxide use and storage industry.</summary>
