  <summary date="2015-02-25T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">General Aviation Pilot Protection Act of 2015

 Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue or revise FAA medical certification regulations to ensure that an individual may operate as a pilot of a covered aircraft without regard to any medical certification or proof of health requirement otherwise applicable under federal law if the flight meets certain criteria and the individual: (1) possesses a valid state driver's license, (2) complies with applicable medical requirements associated with that license, (3) is transporting five or fewer passengers, and (4) is operating under visual or instrument flight rules.

Defines "covered aircraft" as an aircraft that: (1) is not authorized under federal law to carry more than six occupants, and (2) has a maximum certificated takeoff weight of no more than 6,000 pounds.

Prohibits the Administrator from taking enforcement action against a pilot of a covered aircraft for not holding a valid third-class medical certificate if the pilot and the flight meets such requirements, unless the Administrator has published final regulations in the Federal Register.</summary>
