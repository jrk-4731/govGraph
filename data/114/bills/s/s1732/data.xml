Motor carriers may use hair testing as an acceptable alternative to mandatory urinalysis for detecting use of controlled substances by an operator, but only for preemployment testing and random testing.

The bill reauthorizes for FY2016-FY2021:

 hazmat transportation safety projects, and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety programs. DOT shall award separate grants to each state that:

 adopts and is enforcing a law that requires all individuals convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or driving while intoxicated to receive a restriction on driving privileges; and either adopts and is enforcing a mandatory alcohol-ignition interlock law for all individuals convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or of driving while intoxicated, or provides a 24-7 sobriety program.

States may use distracted driving incentive program grants for enforcement of distracted driving laws as well as highway safety program projects.

The bill revises minimum requirements for state graduated driver licensing incentive grant programs.

 DOT shall award incentive grants to states with graduated driving licensing laws that require novice drivers under age 18 (currently, under age 21) to comply with a two-stage licensing process before receiving an unrestricted driver's license.

Such laws shall, at a minimum, include a learner's permit stage that:

 makes a violation of the prohibition against using a personal wireless communications device while driving (with specified emergency exceptions) a primary offense; requires applicants to pass a vision and knowledge assessment before receiving a learner's permit; requires the driver to be accompanied and supervised at all times while operating the motor vehicle by a licensed driver at least age 21 or by a state-certified driving instructor; requires the driver to complete a state-certified driver education or training course or obtain at least 50 hours of behind-the-wheel training (with at least 10 hours at night), with a licensed driver; and remains in effect until the driver attains age 16 and enters the intermediate stage, or attains 18. Such laws shall also include an intermediate permit stage that:

 begins immediately after successful completion of a driving skills assessment, makes a violation of the prohibition against using a personal wireless communications device while driving (with specified emergency exceptions) a primary offense, restricts driving at night between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. when not supervised by a licensed driver age 21 or older (with specified exceptions) for the first six months of the intermediate stage, and remains in effect until the driver attains age 17. The bill reauthorizes for FY2016-FY2021 the administration of DOT motor vehicle safety requirements and requirements for consumer information, bumper standards, odometers, automobile fuel economy, and theft prevention.

 DOT shall implement current information technology, web design trends, and best practices to ensure that motor vehicle safety recall information is readily accessible to the public on its website.

Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act of 2015

The bill authorizes a rental company that receives a notification (approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) from the manufacturer of a covered rental vehicle about any equipment defect, or noncompliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards, to rent or sell the vehicle or equipment only if the defect or noncompliance is remedied.

Covered rental vehicle means one: (1) rated at 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less, (2) rented without a driver for an initial term of under 4 months, and (3) that is part of a motor vehicle fleet of 5 or more motor vehicles used for rental purposes by a rental company.

A rental company may rent (but not sell or lease) a motor vehicle subject to recall if the defect or noncompliance remedy is not immediately available and the company takes any actions specified in the notice to alter the vehicle temporarily to eliminate the safety risk posed.

Rental companies are prohibited from knowingly making inoperable any safety devices or elements of design installed on or in a compliant motor vehicle or vehicle equipment unless the company reasonably believes the vehicle or equipment will not be used when the devices or elements are inoperable.

The bill increases from $5,000 to $14,000 maximum civil penalties for certain violations of motor vehicle safety, and from $35 million to $70 million the maximum civil penalty for a series of violations.

Any data in an event data recorder required to be installed in a passenger motor vehicle shall be the property of the vehicle owner or lessee, regardless of when the vehicle was manufactured.

 DOT shall establish a publicly available electronic tire recall database.

Rail Reform, Enhancement, and Efficiency Act

The bill reauthorizes appropriations for FY2016-FY2019 to DOT for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for:

 the Northeast Corridor investment account, including a state-supported account, a long-distance account, and an other national network activities account; national infrastructure and safety investments grants; National Transportation Safety Board rail investigations; and the Office of the Inspector General. Amtrak shall establish internal controls to ensure its costs, revenues, and other compensation are allocated to specified features of its national network activities.

Amtrak shall submit to Congress and DOT final five-year business line plans and five-year asset plans.

DOT shall develop a program for issuing three-year competitive operating assistance grants to states and other eligible entities to enhance intercity rail passenger service.

Track, Railroad, and Infrastructure Network Act

The bill exempts improvements to, maintenance, rehabilitation, or operation of, railroad or rail transit lines (but not stations) that are in use or were historically used for the transportation of goods or passengers from federal policies and requirements for the preservation of public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites.
