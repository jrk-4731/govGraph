(Sec. 2) This bill confirms that the boundary of Acadia National Park in Maine includes approximately 1,441 acres of land and interests in the Schoodic Peninsula. (Sec. 3) The Department of the Interior may only acquire land or interests in land within the boundaries of the park in accordance with specified law.

The bill repeals certain provisions authorizing Interior to accept property for the extension of Acadia National Park (formerly named Lafayette National Park).

(Sec. 4) Interior shall reestablish and appoint members to the Acadia National Park Advisory Commission.

(Sec. 5) Certain land in the park that was conveyed by Interior to the town of Tremont, Maine, shall no longer be used exclusively for school purposes, but for public purposes, subject to the conditions that: (1) use of the property (on such land) shall not degrade or adversely impact the park's resources or values; and (2) such land shall remain in public ownership for recreational, educational, or similar public purposes.</summary>
