    "text": "Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park Establishment Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 3) This bill establishes the Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park in Missouri as a unit of the National Park System.\n\nThe historical park shall not be established until:\n\n sufficient land has been acquired for the Historical Park to constitute a manageable unit; and the Department of the Interior has entered into an agreement providing that land owned by Missouri, the city of Ste. Genevieve, or other entity within the Ste. Genevieve Historic District National Historic Landmark (historic district) shall be managed consistent with this bill's purposes. Interior may acquire, by donation, purchase, or exchange, any land or interest in land located within the boundary of the historical park or any nationally significant property identified in the special resource study that is within the historic district.\n\n Interior shall revise the boundary of the historical park to include any property from within the historic district that is acquired by Interior.\n\nInterior shall prepare and submit a general management plan for the historical park.\n\nInterior may arrange for interpretive tours and educational programs at related historic and cultural sites within the historic district.\n\nInterior may furnish technical assistance and enter into cooperative agreements with the owner of a nationally significant property within the historical park or the historic district, for the identification, marking, interpretation, improvement, and restoration of such property.\n\nThe federal cost share of any activity carried out under a cooperative agreement under this bill shall be a maximum of 50% of the total cost of that activity. The nonfederal share of an activity may be in the form of fairly valued donated property, goods, or services.\n\nAny payment made by Interior under this bill shall be subject to an agreement that the conversion, use, or disposal of a property or project for purposes contrary to this bill's purposes shall entitle the federal government to reimbursement in any amount equal to the greater of:\n\n the amounts made available to the property or project by the federal government; or the portion of the increased value of the property or project attributable to those amounts, as determined at the time of conversion, use, or disposal. Nothing in this bill authorizes Interior to assume overall financial responsibility for the operation, maintenance, or management of the historic district."
