  <summary date="2015-09-28T14:51:38Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">(Sec. 1) This bill provides that if the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) makes an adverse finding that a VA employee has violated a VA policy for which the employee may be removed or suspended, or has violated a law for which the employee may be imprisoned for more than one year, the VA may not award a bonus to such employee until the earlier of the date that:

 is five years after the end of the fiscal year in which the adverse finding was made, or the finding is found to have been made in error. If an adverse finding is made, the VA, after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing, shall direct the employee to repay any bonus he or she received during the year in which the adverse finding is made, unless such finding is found to have been made in error.

(Sec. 2) If a VA employee receives a reprimand or admonishment the VA shall retain a copy of such reprimand or admonishment in the employee's permanent record as long as he or she is employed by the VA.</summary>
