The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 90 days to act on these applications.\n\nThe bill revises a provision regarding the effective date of the approval of a generic drug that is subject to a patent infringement action.\n\nThe FDA must prioritize the review of, and act within 150 days on, generic drug applications or supplements to generic drug applications for drugs: (1) for which there is a shortage, or (2) that have not been recently introduced to the market by more than one manufacturer and for which tentative approval has not been granted to more than two applications."
