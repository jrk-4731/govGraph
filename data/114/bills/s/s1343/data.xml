  <summary date="2015-05-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to maintain a project to improve hurricane forecasting. The project's goal is to develop and extend accurate hurricane forecasts and warnings in order to reduce loss of life, injury, and damage to the economy, with a focus on: (1) improving the prediction of rapid intensification and track of hurricanes, (2) improving the forecast and communication of storm surges from hurricanes, and (3) incorporating risk communication research to create more effective watch and warning products.

The National Weather Service must develop a plan for that project that details the specific research, development, and technology transfer activities, as well as corresponding resources and timelines, necessary to achieve that goal.</summary>
