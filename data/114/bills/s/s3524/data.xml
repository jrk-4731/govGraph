  <summary date="2016-12-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Federal Rules of Evidence to establish a procedure to prohibit pro se criminal defendants (defendants representing themselves without a lawyer) accused of sexual assault of a minor under age 18 from cross-examining the minor.

Upon application by the prosecutor, the minor, or the minor's representative, the defendant is prohibited from conducting such a cross-examination unless the court finds that it is necessitated by exceptional circumstances to protect the defendant's constitutional rights. The cross-examination of the minor shall instead be conducted by an attorney for the defendant under the court's supervision.</summary>
