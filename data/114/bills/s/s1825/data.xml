This bill prohibits the Department of Energy (DOE) from making an expenditure from the Nuclear Waste Fund for the costs incurred by DOE in connection with the transportation, treating, or packaging of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste to be disposed of in a repository site, to be stored in a monitored, retrievable storage site, or to be used in a test and evaluation facility, or for the costs associated with acquisition, design, modification, replacement, operation, and construction of facilities at such a site, unless DOE has entered into an agreement to host a repository with:

 the governor of the state in which the repository is proposed to be located, each affected local government and any contiguous local government through which spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste will be transported for disposal at the repository, and each affected Indian tribe. Any such agreement must be written and signed by all parties, shall be binding on the parties, and shall not be amended or revoked except by mutual agreement of the parties.</summary>
