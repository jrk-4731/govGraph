  <summary date="2015-03-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">NTIS Elimination Act

Repeals the National Technical Information Act of 1988, which provided for establishment of the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), effective one year after the enactment of this Act.

Directs the Secretary of Commerce, the Archivist of the United States, and the Comptroller General to consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to determine if any NTIS activity or function is critical to the national economy and is not being carried out by any other federal government agency, instrumentality, or contractor. Authorizes the the Secretary to transfer responsibility for any such activity or function to another office within Commerce. Directs the Secretary, before one year after enactment of this Act, to certify that all other NTIS operations have been terminated.

Defines as "critical to the national economy" an activity or function that promotes U.S. economic growth by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery.

Authorizes Commerce to continue to maintain a permanent repository of nonclassified scientific, technical, and engineering information, which shall be publicly available and searchable in a format useful to American industry, business, libraries, and research institutions. Requires all federal entities to send electronic copies of all nonclassified scientific, technical, and engineering reports and information to Commerce for inclusion in the repository.

Directs the Department of the Treasury to transfer all unexpended balances in the NTIS Revolving Fund to Commerce to be expended solely for the maintenance of the repository and to dissolve the Fund.</summary>
