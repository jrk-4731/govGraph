This bill deems to be a qualified health plan for 2017 any state-authorized health insurance offered in the individual or small group market in certain states. (Qualified health plans purchased through a health insurance exchange are eligible for premium subsidies.) This applies in states that: (1) determine that temporary access to affordable private health insurance outside of a health insurance exchange is necessary to ensure access to an adequate number of affordable private health insurance options in the individual or small group market; and (2) notify the Department of Health and Human Services of that determination no later than November 1, 2016.

Residents of such a state are not subject to the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage in 2017.</summary>
