The civilian contractor protections, which are currently in effect as a pilot program, are made permanent.\n\nThe bill extends the prohibition against reimbursement of legal fees incurred in defending against reprisal claims brought by whistle-blowers to defense and civilian subcontractors and personal services contractors."
