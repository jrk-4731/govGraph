This bill amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act to establish a Department of Agriculture (USDA) program to provide competitive grants to small cheese producers and cooperative groups of small cheese producers.

In awarding grants, USDA must define the term "small cheese producer" and give preference to producers that: (1) purchase raw dairy product from producers located in the same state as the small cheese producers, or (2) produce raw dairy product on the farms of the small cheese producers.

Grant recipients may use the funds to:

 purchase equipment or renovate and make repairs to production facilities, develop a business plan or perform a feasibility study to grow the business, promote and market cheese, participate in accounting and financial literacy education and training, and carry out food safety upgrades and training. Using no more than 10% of the funds provided for this bill, USDA must establish a cheese production, education, and promotion pilot project at eligible institutions, including:

 land-grant colleges or universities, local offices of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture or other regional USDA offices, groups of regional experts that advise beginning farmers or ranchers, or nonprofit organizations.</summary>
