This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to provide funding for prioritized activities, studies, or projects that advance the goals and objectives of the comprehensive management plan for the San Francisco estuary. Funding may be provided through cooperative agreements, grants, or other means. Funding may not be used for the administration of a management conference for the San Francisco estuary under the National Estuary Program.

Funding amounts provided under this Act may not exceed 75% of the total cost of eligible activities to be carried out using those amounts.

This bill authorizes appropriations for the funding program through FY2019.</summary>
