  <summary date="2015-05-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">PURPA's Legislative Upgrade to State Authority Act or the PURPA PLUS Act

Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, with respect to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authority to prescribe rules requiring electric utilities to offer to sell and purchase electric energy to and from any qualifying cogeneration or small power production facility.

Permits state regulatory authorities or nonregulated electric utilities, acting under state authority, to set rates exceeding the incremental cost of alternative electric energy for purchases from any such qualifying facility of up to two megawatts capacity. (Current law requires FERC to set rates that do not exceed the incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy.)</summary>
