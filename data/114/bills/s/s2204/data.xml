This bill prohibits any federal or state law, regulation, or agency action from restricting the right of a mentally competent adult who is suffering from an advanced illness with intolerable pain or a terminal illness to receive pain relief treatment from a physician.

A physician who treats such an individual is not subject to criminal or civil prosecution or professional disciplinary action if the physician obtains the written informed consent of the patient through a form that must be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services.</summary>
