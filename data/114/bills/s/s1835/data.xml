  <summary date="2015-07-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Military Facilities Force Protection Act of 2015

This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to station military police or other military personnel armed with firearms at military recruiting and reserve component facilities for the exclusive purpose of force protection.

 DOD is authorized to enter into memoranda of understanding with state or local law enforcement agencies or National Guards to provide such protection if military personnel are not available.

DOD shall:

 implement a training program for all force protection personnel stationed under this Act; implement measures to improve the security of existing military recruitment and reserve component facilities, including installation of bullet-proof glass and enhanced video surveillance equipment; and relocate a facility for which adequate security improvements cannot be made to a location consistent with required security improvements.</summary>
