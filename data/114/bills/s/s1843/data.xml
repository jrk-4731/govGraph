This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a law enforcement notification system for every state.

"Law enforcement notification system" means a secure information sharing system utilized by federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies to:

 notify the identification bureaus of the state from which an alien is being released and of the state in which the alien is intending to reside of the anticipated release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable under specified grounds, and notify DHS of the release from custody of an alien who has been arrested for certain offenses the conviction of any one of which would render the alien inadmissible. DHS shall establish a secure information sharing system that enables state, tribal, and local courts to notify DHS of a protective order issued against an inadmissible or deportable alien who is under DHS supervision.</summary>
