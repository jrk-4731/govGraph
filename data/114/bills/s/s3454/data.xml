  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services to research and report on medication adherence with respect to federal health care programs. ("Medication adherence" refers to&#160;the extent to which patients take their medications as prescribed.)

In addition, the bill amends titles XI (General Provisions) and XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to:

 upon request by a prescription drug plan (PDP)&#160;sponsor, provide the plan with Medicare enrollee claims data to provide context for&#160;an enrollee's medication regimen; in&#160;calculating the minimum medical loss ratio&#160;with respect to&#160;PDPs, include medication management as an activity that improves health care quality; and through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, test a model for enhanced medication therapy management for PDPs under Medicare Advantage.</summary>
