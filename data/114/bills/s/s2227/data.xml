  <summary date="2015-11-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Private Spectrum Relocation Funding Act of 2015 

&#160;

This bill amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to allow a federal entity to receive payment or reimbursement from a private entity to accelerate implementation of a transition plan deemed sufficient by a technical panel within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for federally used frequencies of electromagnetic spectrum to be relocated or shared to make spectrum available for auction or for other commercial or nonfederal use.

&#160;

To collect or receive such a payment or reimbursement, the technical panel must approve a federal entity's proposal with a finding that: (1) the activities funded by the payment are reasonably likely to materially accelerate implementation of the transition plan or commercial or other nonfederal use of spectrum subject to such plan, and (2) such implementation or use would not be achieved without the private entity's payment.</summary>
