  <summary date="2015-02-11T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Enhancing Education Through Technology Act of 2015

Replaces part D (Enhancing Education Through Technology) of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) with a new part D (Achievement Through Technology and Innovation).

Directs the Secretary of Education to award matching grants to states and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to strengthen state and local technological infrastructure and professional learning that supports digital learning.

Allocates grant funds among states in proportion to each state's share of school improvement funds under part A of title I of the ESEA.

Requires states to use at least 90% of their grant to award subgrants to LEAs.

Requires LEAs to use: (1) at least 40% of those funds to support the acquisition of technology that addresses their technology infrastructure and access needs; and (2) at least 40% of those funds to provide digital age professional learning opportunities for teachers, principals, school leaders, paraprofessionals, library and media personnel, specialized instructional support personnel, technology coordinators, and administrators.

Allows states to form purchasing consortia with other states, and allows LEAs to form purchasing consortia with other LEAs, to carry out grant and subgrant activities, including the purchase of technology.</summary>
