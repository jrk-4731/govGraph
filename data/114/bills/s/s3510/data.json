An individual who has not met such admission renewal requirements may be granted up to two one-year renewals if: (1) he or she has made substantial progress in meeting such criteria, and (2) such renewal is economically beneficial to the United States.\n\nThe bill establishes an employment-based entrepreneur immigrant visa for an individual who: (1) has a significant ownership interest in a U.S. business entity, (2) is employed in a senior executive position at such entity, (3) submits a business plan to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and (4) had a substantial role in the founding or early-stage growth and development of such entity.\n\nThe bill sets forth visa criteria, which shall include qualifying: (1) nonimmigrant U.S. residency, (2) job creation, (3) investment and revenue amounts, (4) education levels, and (5) ownership in a U.S. entity.\n\nUp to 10,000 entrepreneur immigrant visas shall be made available each fiscal year."
