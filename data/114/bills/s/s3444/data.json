    "text": "Education Support Professional Family Medical Leave Act\n\nThis bill amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to provide that employees who are education support professionals will be considered as meeting the hours of service requirement to become eligible for family or medical leave under the Act, if they have worked, during the previous 12-month period, at least an average of:\n\n 60 hours a month for the employer from whom the leave is requested, or 60% of the total monthly hours expected for the employee's job description and duties with regard to that employer. The bill defines an \"education support professional\" as an employee of a public elementary or secondary school or public institution of higher education that may include: (1) a paraeducator who provides instructional or noninstructional support; and (2) a member of the secretarial, clerical, or administrative support staff (e.g., bus drivers, janitors, kitchen workers, and security guards).\n\nThe Department of Labor may provide a method for calculating leave under the Act for education support professionals."
