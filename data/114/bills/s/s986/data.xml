Albuquerque Indian School Land Transfer Act

 (Sec. 3) Directs the Department of the Interior to take into trust 4 tracts of federal land in New Mexico, the combined acreage of which is approximately 11.11 acres, that were historically part of the Albuquerque Indian School for the benefit of 19 specified pueblos immediately after the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 have been satisfied regarding the trust acquisition of such federal land.

Requires the federal lands taken into trust to be used for the educational, health, cultural, business, and economic development of the 19 pueblos. Requires the federal lands taken into trust to remain subject to any private or municipal encumbrance, right-of-way, restriction, easement of record, or utility service agreement in effect on this Act's enactment date.

Requires the 19 pueblos to allow the Bureau of Indian Affairs to continue to use the federal lands taken into trust for the facilities and purposes as in existence on this Act's enactment date.

(Sec. 4) Prohibits gaming from being carried out on the federal lands taken into trust under this Act.</summary>
