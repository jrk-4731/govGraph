This bill establishes in the Treasury the Strengthening America's Bridges Fund to furnish amounts to the Department of Transportation to make grants to states for the repair or maintenance of any bridges classified as deficient in the National Bridge Inventory.

The Internal Revenue Code is amended with respect to the requirement that taxpayers claiming the refundable portion of the child tax credit include on their tax returns the name and taxpayer identification number (e.g., Social Security number) of their qualifying child. Any such credit is disallowed to any taxpayer that fails to include such a name and tax identification number on his or her tax return.

Amounts equivalent to the increase in revenues from this child tax credit amendment are appropriated to the Fund for such grants.</summary>
