  <summary date="2016-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Improved Employment Outcomes for Foster Youth Act of 2016 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to include the hiring of qualified foster care transition youth.

(The WOTC permits employers who hire individuals who are members of a targeted group [e.g., qualified veterans, ex-felons, SSI recipients] to claim a tax credit equal to a portion of the wages paid to those individuals.)

A "qualified foster care transition youth" is any individual who is certified by the designated local agency as: (1) not having attained age 27 as of the hiring date, and (2) as having been in foster care after attaining the younger of age 16 or the age specified in provisions of the Social Security Act related to the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.</summary>
