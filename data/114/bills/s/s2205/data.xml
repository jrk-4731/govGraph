  <summary date="2015-10-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts Act of 2015

This bill permits the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to tribal governments acting in partnership with state or local governments for tribal healing to wellness courts. (A tribal healing to wellness court is a drug court that is a component of a tribal justice system and includes substance abuse treatment and may include cultural activities.)

Courts receiving grants must monitor individuals under their jurisdiction and must periodically test each individual for drug use. DOJ may require these courts to increase punitive or treatment responses for an individual who fails a drug test.

Violent offenders may not be under the jurisdiction of these courts unless the court has received a waiver from DOJ.</summary>
