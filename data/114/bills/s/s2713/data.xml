(Sec. 2) This bill encourages the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to carry out a Precision Medicine Initiative to address disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The initiative may include collection of health information from a diverse cohort of individuals. HHS may carry out specified activities relating to the initiative, including coordinating with the Department of Energy to address supercomputing needs.

In implementing the initiative, HHS must: (1) collaborate with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration, and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology; (2) implement secure data sharing; and (3) ensure inclusion of a broad range of participants, considering factors that contribute to health disparities.

(Sec. 3) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise provisions regarding disclosure by researchers of the identifiable, sensitive information of research subjects. HHS must prohibit researchers from disclosing such information from federally funded research to persons not connected to the research. Researchers may apply to have other research covered by this prohibition.

Disclosures of such information are permitted if required by law, necessary for the medical treatment of the research subject, made with the consent of the subject, or made for the purposes of other research that is in compliance with regulations regarding protection of subjects.

(Sec. 4) HHS may exempt identifiable information collected for biomedical research from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

(Sec. 5) The NIH may require recipients of grants or cooperative agreements to share scientific data.

(Sec. 6) The NIH may approve requests by national research institutes to fund high-impact, cutting-edge research through transactions other than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements. National research institutes must conduct and support high-risk, high-reward research.</summary>
