The Secretary must also provide a detailed explanation of:\n\n proposals to reduce the debt and a progress report on implementing them; the impact an increased debt limit will have on future spending, debt service, and the position of the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency; projections of the fiscal health and sustainability of major entitlement programs; measures Treasury is taking or intends to take to avoid default, including a plan to publicly disclose the details; and Treasury's capability to pay only principal and interest on the debt if the limit is reached. Treasury must make specified information required by this bill available to the public on its website.\n\nUpon request, Treasury must submit to Congress specified financial and economic data relevant to determining the amount of the public debt."
