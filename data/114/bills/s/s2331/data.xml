 This bill amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) to make any predispute arbitration agreement invalid or unenforceable against a servicemember, or a servicemember and the servicemember's spouse jointly, with respect to any controversy subject to such Act.

A servicemember's waiver of any SCRA rights and protections shall be effective only if made after a specific dispute has arisen and the dispute is identified in the waiver.

A representative of members of an aggrieved class, or a member of such class, may bring a private civil action for a violation of any SCRA rights or protections.</summary>
