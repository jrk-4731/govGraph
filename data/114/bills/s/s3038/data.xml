TITLE I--COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1972 AMENDMENTS

(Sec.101)This bill amends the findings in the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) about the national interest in coastal zones to include coastal resilience, tourism, and energy development. The revised findings also state that the participation and coordination of local governments are important to protecting state coastal interests.

(Sec. 103) The Coastal Resource Improvement Program under CZMA is expanded to add to its grant objectives the preservation or redevelopment of working waterfronts.

(Sec. 104) Interstate compacts are authorized for the management of state coastal zones and shared interstate resources. NOAA may provide mediation for disputes between a federal agency and a coastal state or two or more coastal states.

(Sec. 105) Objectives for coastal zone enhancement grants under CZMA are expanded to include interstate water resource and coastal management planning, policies to ensure sufficient state response to the environmental, economic, and social impacts of oil spills or other accidents, and maximizing the efficiency of processing permits for coastal zone activities.

(Sec. 106) NOAA is required to evaluate the National Estuarine Research Reserve System periodically to determine if any of the protected areas in the estuarine reserves should be expanded.

(Sec. 107) NOAA must submit to Congress a report summarizing any actions it takes in accordance with this bill for five consecutive fiscal years.

TITLE II--GULF OF MEXICO REGIONAL COORDINATION

(Sec.202) The purposes of this title are to: (1) expand and strengthen the cooperative voluntary efforts to conserve and restore the Gulf of Mexico; (2) recognize and enable the Gulf of Mexico Alliance as a coordinating entity; and (3) enable grant funding for coordination management, scientific research, conservation, and restoration activities.

(Sec.203)This title also authorizes eligible entities (i.e., a consortium of the five states that have a shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico), in consultation with NOAA, to develop strategies for the conservation and restoration of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem and to develop and implement action plans to carry out such strategies.

TITLE III--COASTAL ZONE IMPACTS

(Sec.301)The bill amends the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to add NOAA, the Department of Commerce, and any potentially impacted coastal state to the list of entities that can be consulted under the Act.Impacted coastal states may provide recommendations to mitigate impacts to fisheries, wildlife, and wildlife resources.</summary>
