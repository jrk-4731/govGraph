 This bill states U.S. policy that Department of Defense (DOD) personnel shall be appropriately armed and have the inherent right to self-defense.

 Current regulations and directives, or any provision in any other rule, regulation, or executive order prohibiting military personnel trained in firearms from carrying personal firearms on U.S. military installations shall have no further force or effect with regard to such military personnel, and they shall not be prohibited from carrying personal firearms on U.S. military installations.

The bill directs DOD to establish a process by which the commander of a military installation in the United States may authorize a qualifying member of the Armed Forces assigned to duty at the installation to carry a concealed personal firearm on the installation if the commander determines it to be necessary as a personal-protection or force-protection measure.

The commander of the installation shall consult with appropriate state and local elected officials and take into consideration state and local laws law regarding carrying a concealed personal firearm.</summary>
