  <summary date="2015-11-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Protecting Americans from the Proliferation of Weapons to Terrorists Act of 2015 

This bill prohibits the obligation or expenditure of funds made available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, the National Security Agency, or any other U.S. agency or entity involved in intelligence activities for the purpose of, or in a manner which would have the effect of, supporting military or paramilitary operations in Syria.

An exception is provided for funds obligated for non-lethal humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people provided directly by the U.S. government through nongovernmental organizations and contractors or foreign governments.

The prohibition may only be nullified if a joint resolution approving assistance for military or paramilitary operations in Syria is enacted.</summary>
