This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition on transferring a firearm knowing that the firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.

Specifically, it broadens the scope of the prohibition to bar the transfer or receipt of a firearm, or the attempt or conspiracy to do so, knowing or reasonably believing that the firearm will be used to commit a crime of violence, a drug trafficking crime, or a federal crime of terrorism. It increases from 10 to 15 years the maximum prison term for a violator.

Additionally, the bill adds a new provision to prohibit the transfer of an explosive precursor (i.e., a chemical substance used to make explosive material) knowing or reasonably believing that that the explosive precursor will be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. It imposes penalties&#8212;a fine, a 10-year maximum prison term, or both&#8212;on a person who violates, or attempts or conspires to violate, the prohibition.

 Finally, the bill imposes penalties&#8212;a fine, a 10-year maximum prison term, or both&#8212;on a person who conspires or attempts to transfer explosive materials knowing or reasonably believing that the explosive materials will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.</summary>
