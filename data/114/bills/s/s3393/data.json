It increases from 10 to 15 years the maximum prison term for a violator.\n\nAdditionally, the bill adds a new provision to prohibit the transfer of an explosive precursor (i.e., a chemical substance used to make explosive material) knowing or reasonably believing that that the explosive precursor will be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. It imposes penalties\u2014a fine, a 10-year maximum prison term, or both\u2014on a person who violates, or attempts or conspires to violate, the prohibition.\n\n Finally, the bill imposes penalties\u2014a fine, a 10-year maximum prison term, or both\u2014on a person who conspires or attempts to transfer explosive materials knowing or reasonably believing that the explosive materials will be used to commit a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime."
