This bill directs the Department of the Navy to establish a pilot program for the commercialization of products and services produced by covered small business concerns under which the Department shall set up a multiple task or delivery order contract for those products and services.

 Nothing in this bill shall be construed to prevent the commercialization of products and services produced by a small business concern under a federal agency Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program through:

 direct awards for Phase III of an SBIR or STTR program; awards made under the Rapid Innovation Fund (for accelerating the fielding of innovative technologies developed using Department of Defense [DOD] research funding, and expedient DOD use of such technologies in defense acquisition programs); or any other contract vehicle.</summary>
