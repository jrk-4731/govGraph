The President is authorized to designate a U.S. government official to lead an interagency team and to manage the center.\n\n The center may provide grants to or contract with specified entities to:\n\n support local independent media to refute foreign disinformation and manipulation in their communities, collect and store examples of disinformation and propaganda directed at the United States and its allies, analyze foreign government information warfare tactics and techniques, and support center efforts to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts to influence the policies and social and political stability of the United States and its allies. The President shall ensure that the State Department, when selecting participants for U.S. educational and cultural exchange programs, gives special consideration to students and community leaders from populations and countries deemed vulnerable to foreign propaganda and disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe center shall terminate 15 years after enactment of this Act."
