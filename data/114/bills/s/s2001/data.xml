This bill prohibits the Secretary of Labor, for a three-year period, from issuing any special wage certificate under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to certain entities, allowing them to pay individuals with disabilities subminimum wages, except as a renewal of a special wage certificate previously issued to the entity.

Any such special wage certificate issued or renewed shall be void three years after enactment of this Act.

Authority for such special wage certificates is repealed as of three years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
