This bill establishes the Interagency Rapid Response Team for Transmission (Team), composed of specified federal agencies, to expedite the permitting process for electric transmission infrastructure on both federal and non-federal land.

The Team shall:

 facilitate coordination and unified environmental documentation among electric transmission infrastructure project applicants, federal agencies, states, and Indian tribes; establish clear timelines for the review and coordination of projects; ensure that each project is posted on the "e-Trans" federal permitting transmission tracking system; and notify Team members involved in any specific permit of any outstanding agency action required with respect to the permit, and any approval or required comment that has exceeded statutory or agency timelines for completion. The Transmission Ombudsperson, established by this Act within the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall create a process for permitting maintenance and upgrades to electric transmission lines and resolving complaints.

The Department of the Interior must not take certain actions under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 with respect to rights-of-way reserved for a federal agency or department for an electric transmission system unless the agency or department head proposes to change the use of the right-of-way to support a function other than an electric transmission system.

The actions prohibited unless a change of use is proposed include:

 requiring a new grant, permit, or renewal of the grant or permit relating to the right-of-way; requiring any other authorization or instrument relating to the right-of-way; or imposing new terms or conditions relating to the right-of-way or its use, including proposed changes affecting electric transmission system facilities or appurtenances.</summary>
