This bill amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require any state receiving a TANF block grant to maintain policies and practices to ensure that cash assistance disbursed through an electronic benefit transfer card or an electronic payment card shall not be used to withdraw more than $25 per day from an automated teller machine or through a cash-back procedure at a point of sale terminal.

The Department of Health and Human Services shall reduce to $0 the state family assistance grant payable to any state which, within two years after enactment of this Act, has not reported on its implementation of this cash withdrawal limit or has not implemented such a limit.</summary>
