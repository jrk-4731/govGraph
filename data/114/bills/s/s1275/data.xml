This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program to provide grants to establish or expand programs to finance energy efficiency retrofit, onsite clean and renewable energy, smart grid systems, and alternative vehicle fleet projects for industrial businesses.

DOE must establish a process to identify financing opportunities for manufacturing and industrial business with asset portfolios across multiple states.

Grant recipients must give a higher priority to those programs that: (1) leverage private and nonfederal sources of funding, and (2) aim to expand the use of energy efficiency project financing using private sources of funding.

Grant recipients must also collect, share, and report on data resulting from programs carried out under this bill. DOE must incorporate the data into appropriate DOE databases, with provisions for the protection of confidential business data.</summary>
