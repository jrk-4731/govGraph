    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on November 16, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nFirst Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to carry out a pilot program to provide eligible anthrax vaccines nearing the end of their labeled dates of use from the strategic national stockpile to emergency response providers who would be at high risk of exposure to anthrax if an attack should occur and who voluntarily consent.\n\nHHS shall determine whether an anthrax vaccine is eligible to be provided to DHS for the program based on determinations that: (1) the vaccine is not otherwise allotted for other purposes; and (2) the provision of the vaccine will not reduce or otherwise adversely affect the capability to meet projected requirements for such product during a public health emergency.\n\nDHS shall establish a communication platform, develop and deliver education and training, conduct an economic analysis, create a logistical platform, establish goals and desired outcomes for the program, and establish a mechanism to reimburse HHS for the costs of shipment and transportation of such vaccines provided to DHS under such program and the amount by which the warehousing costs of the stockpile are increased in order to operate such program.\n\nDHS must: (1) select between two and five states for voluntary participation in the program; (2) provide guidance to participating states and local governments on identifying providers who are at high risk of exposure; and (3) require each participating state to submit a written certification that each participating emergency response provider is provided with disclosures and educational materials regarding the associated benefits and risks of any vaccine provided and of exposure to anthrax, additional material consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's clinical guidance, and notice that the federal government is not obligated to continue providing anthrax vaccine after the program ends.\n\nEach state that participates in the program shall ensure that such participation is consistent with the state's All-Hazards Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.\n\nDHS shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with HHS to: (1) define each department's roles and responsibilities, and (2) establish appropriate performance metrics and policies for the program.\n\nDHS must submit annual reports on program progress and results, which shall include the costs to administer the program, the number and percentage of eligible providers that volunteer to participate, the degree to which participants complete the vaccine regimen, the total number of doses of vaccine administered, and recommendations to improve participation.\n\n The final report shall consider whether the program should continue beyond five years after enactment of this bill and shall include: (1) an analysis of the costs and benefits of continuing the program; (2) an explanation of the economic, health, and other risks and benefits of administering vaccines through the program rather than post-event treatment; and (3) a plan under which the program could be continued."
