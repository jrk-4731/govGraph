This bill reauthorizes the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 and revises the purpose for grants for lead-based paint hazard reduction in target housing.

Such grants shall be made instead for reduction of lead-based paint hazards and correction of other housing-related hazards, including any condition of residential real property that poses a risk of biological, physical, radiological, or chemical exposure that can adversely affect human health.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development may establish a process by which, in order to verify a family's income level, a grantee may first obtain and use income and program participation information from an entity administering:

 the HOME Investment Partnerships program under the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act; the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children established under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; reduced price or free lunches under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act; the weatherization assistance program for low-income persons established under the Energy Conservation and Production Act; the temporary assistance for needy families program under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSAct); the supplemental security income program under SSAct title XVI; or any other program consistent with the family income requirements of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. An Indian tribe and a private nonprofit organization shall be eligible to apply for such a grant, in addition to certain state or local governments, for specified activities relating to lead-based paint hazards.

A private nonprofit organization shall also be eligible to apply for a grant to reduce housing-related health hazards.

The bill revises grantee selection criteria for a grant to carry out activities relating to lead-based paint hazards, and prescribes criteria for activities relating to housing-related hazards.

The bill also prescribes an allocation of funds for grants to assess and correct housing-related health hazards and evaluate the effectiveness of such assessments and corrections.</summary>
