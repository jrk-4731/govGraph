  <summary date="2015-10-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Net Price Calculator Improvement Act

This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish the minimum requirements for the net price calculator that an institution of higher education (IHE) receiving federal funds under title IV (Student Assistance) of the Act must include on its website. (An IHE's net price is the average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving student aid at the school after deducting such aid.)

 It authorizes the Department of Education to develop a universal net price calculator that enables users to answer one set of questions and receive net prices for any IHE that is required to have a net price calculator.</summary>
