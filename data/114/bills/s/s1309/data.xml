  <summary date="2015-05-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Federal Adjustment in Reporting Student Credit Act of 2015 or the FAIR Student Credit Act of 2015 

Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow a person to request the removal of a previously reported default regarding a qualified education loan from a consumer report if: (1) the lender chooses to offer a loan rehabilitation program that requires a number of consecutive on-time monthly payments equal to the number of payments specified in a default reduction program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, and (2) the consumer of such loan successfully and voluntarily meets the requirements of that loan rehabilitation program.

Permits a consumer to obtain such rehabilitation benefits only once per loan.

Requires the Government Accountability Office to report on any hurdles borrowers experience with the private loan rehabilitation program.</summary>
