(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Marine Debris Act to revise the Marine Debris Program by requiring the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to work with: (1) other agencies to address both land- and sea-based sources of marine debris, and (2) the Department of State and other agencies to promote international action to reduce the incidence of marine debris.

(Sec. 3) The bill also revises the program by allowing NOAA to make sums available for assisting in the cleanup and response required by severe marine debris events.

(Sec. 4) The bill urges the President to: (1) work with foreign countries that produce the largest amounts of unmanaged municipal solid waste that reaches the ocean in order to find solution to the marine debris; and (2) study issues related to marine debris, including the economic impacts of marine debris.

(Sec. 5) The Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee must expand to include a senior official from the Department of State.

(Sec. 6) This bill reauthorizes through FY2021: (1) the Marine Debris Program, (2) an information clearinghouse on marine debris, and (3) enforcement of laws about discarded marine debris from ships.</summary>
