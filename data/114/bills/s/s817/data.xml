  <summary date="2016-12-15T04:59:59Z" status="Public Law">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Siletz Tribe Indian Restoration Act to authorize the Department of the Interior to take into trust for the Siletz Tribe additional lands that lie within the original 1855 Siletz Coast Reservation and are located in Benton, Douglas, Lane, Lincoln, Tillamook, and Yamhill counties in Oregon.

Such land must be considered and evaluated as an on-reservation acquisition and become part of the tribe's reservation. (Off-reservation land acquisition requests require Interior to give greater scrutiny to the tribe's justification of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition.)

Gaming is prohibited on lands taken into trust pursuant to this Act.</summary>
