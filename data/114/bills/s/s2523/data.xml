This bill authorizes the Department of the Army, effective as of August 2, 2007, to provide by contract or otherwise for the production, treatment, management, and use of natural gas located under Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Such natural gas may only be used to support activities and operations at Fort Knox and may not be sold for use elsewhere.

The Army may take ownership of any gas production and treatment equipment and facilities and associated infrastructure from a contractor in accordance with the terms of a contract or other agreement.

The authority provided by this bill applies only to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and nothing in this bill authorizes the production, treatment, management, or use of natural gas resources underlying any other Department of Defense installation.</summary>
