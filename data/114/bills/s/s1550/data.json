The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nProgram Management Improvement Accountability Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill establishes as additional functions of the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements to:\n\n adopt and oversee implementation of government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management for executive agencies; chair the Program Management Policy Council (established by this Act); establish standards and policies for executive agencies consistent with widely accepted standards for program and project management planning and delivery; engage with the private sector to identify best practices in program and project management that would improve federal program and project management; conduct portfolio reviews to address programs identified as high risk by the Government Accountability Office (GAO); conduct portfolio reviews of agency programs at least annually to assess the quality and effectiveness of program management; and establish a five-year strategic plan for program and project management. The bill exempts the Department of Defense (DOD) from such provisions to the extent that they are substantially similar to: (1) federal provisions governing the defense acquisition workforce; or (2) policy, guidance, or instruction of DOD related to program management.\n\nThe head of each federal agency that is required to have a Chief Financial Officer shall designate a Program Management Improvement Officer to implement agency program management policies and develop a strategy for enhancing the role of program managers within the agency. The OMB must submit a report containing such strategy within one year after enactment of this bill. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics shall be considered the Program Management Improvement Officer for DOD.\n\nThe Program Management Policy Council is established within OMB to act as the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to program and project management.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management must issue regulations that: (1) identify key skills and competencies needed for an agency program and project manager, (2) establish a new job series or update and improve an existing job series for program and project management within an agency, and (3) establish a new career path for program and project managers.\n\nThe GAO must issue a report within three years of enactment, in conjunction with its high risk list, examining the effectiveness of the following (as required or established under this Act) on improving federal program and project management:\n\n the standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management; the strategic plan; Program Management Improvement Officers; and the Program Management Policy Council."
