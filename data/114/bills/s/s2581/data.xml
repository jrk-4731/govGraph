This bill directs the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to: (1)&#160; provide a&#160;taxpayer who&#160;is selected for an audit sufficient information regarding the reason the taxpayer's return was selected for an audit and to preserve such information for review; (2) document and record how many returns are selected for audit based on randomized selection, scoring under the Discriminant Index Function System, a determination by an IRS examiner, and other methodologies; and (3) repurpose resources for the National Research Program (taxpayer data collection program)&#160;to combat tax refund fraud and identity theft.

The bill prohibits the IRS from conducting&#160;any audit, investigation, or examination of a taxpayer that is primarily for research purposes.</summary>
