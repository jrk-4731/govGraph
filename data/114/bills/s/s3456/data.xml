DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties shall conduct an annual review to ensure that OPAVE's activities that relate to countering violent extremism respect the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of all persons.

DHS shall submit to Congress a comprehensive DHS strategy and an implementation plan to counter violent extremism in the United States.
