  <summary date="2016-02-25T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Terrorist Release Transparency Act

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that the people of the United States: (1) deserve to know who is being released from the detention facilities at U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, their countries of origin, their destinations, and the ability of the host nation to prevent recidivism; and (2) deserve transparency in the manner in which the Obama Administration complies with Executive Order 13492.

Not less than 15 days before a detained individual's transfer to the custody or control of the individual's country of origin, any other foreign country, or any other foreign entity, the Department of State shall submit to Congress an unclassified notice that includes:

 the name, country of origin, and country of destination of the individual; the number of individuals detained at Guantanamo previously transferred to the country to which the individual is proposed to be transferred; and the number of such individuals who have re-engaged in terrorist activity after being transferred to that country.</summary>
