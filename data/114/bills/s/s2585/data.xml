This bill amends the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 to direct the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish an advisory committee to review and comment on any proposed change in FAA regulations, policies, or guidance relating to airspace that affects airport operations, airport capacity, the environment, or communities in the vicinity of airports before any such proposal is made available for public comment and before it is implemented.

The advisory committee shall review FAA:

 practices and procedures for developing such proposals, assessing the consultation, or lack of it, among affected FAA elements and between the FAA and affected entities; and management of database systems used to evaluate data relating to obstructions to air navigation or navigational facilities.</summary>
