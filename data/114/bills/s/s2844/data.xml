Highlights: 

This bill provides FY2017 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and several related agencies.

The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The HUD budget is primarily discretionary spending, and most of the DOT budget is mandatory spending, in the form of contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund.

The bill decreases net discretionary budget authority for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies below FY2016 levels. (When savings due to certain rescissions and receipts are taken into account, the new discretionary budget authority available to agencies funded in the bill is above the FY2016 level.)

Compared to FY2016 levels, the bill decreases discretionary funding for DOT (including the effects of a rescission of unused contract authority) and increases discretionary funding for HUD.

The bill also includes a provision that affects DOT regulations regarding commercial truck drivers' rest periods.
