Highlights: 

This bill provides FY2017 appropriations for the Department of Agriculture (USDA), except for the Forest Service which is included in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.

Also included in the bill are provisions that affect policies in areas such as:
