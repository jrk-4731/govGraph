    "text": "Higher Education Access and Success for Homeless and Foster Youth Act\n\nThis bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise provisions related to financial aid and educational programs for children and youths who are homeless or in foster care.\n\nWith respect to a student's independence for purposes of financial aid, a financial aid administrator must: (1)\u00a0in the absence of conflicting information,\u00a0accept a homelessness determination made by an authorized individual; and (2) make such a determination if the student cannot get documentation from a designated authority. A student who is determined to be independent\u00a0on this basis\u00a0shall generally be presumed to be independent for a subsequent award year at the same institution.\n\nThe bill expands the duties of the Student Loan Ombudsman to include the review and resolution of complaints regarding such determinations.\n\nTo be eligible for\u00a0certain federal funds, an institution must meet specified requirements related to student housing, coordination, and notice of financial assistance eligibility with respect to children and youths who are homeless or in foster care.\n\nIn approving applications for\u00a0entities to carry out specified programs related to higher education,\u00a0the Department of Education\u00a0shall require an entity to make specified assurances with respect to the participation of children and youths who are homeless or in foster care. A federal work-study agreement must prioritize employment for such students.\n\nFor purposes of income-based financial aid determinations, the bill excludes from income: (1) the value of specified vouchers for education and training, and (2) direct payments made through an extended foster care program.\n\nWith respect to children or youths who are homeless or in foster care, a\u00a0state may not charge a tuition rate that is higher than the in-state tuition rate."
