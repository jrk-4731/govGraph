 Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to:

 establish standards for determining the maximum passenger capacity for recreational vessels, expressed in the number of passengers and in pounds; require manufacturers and operators of passenger vessels to permanently display such maximum capacity in a legible manner that is clearly visible to passengers; and require operators to post notice of the need to balance vessel weight to avoid capsizing. Defines a "recreational vehicle" as any vessel that is manufactured or used primarily for pleasure, excluding any vessel that is subject to Coast Guard inspection and engaged in commercial use.</summary>
