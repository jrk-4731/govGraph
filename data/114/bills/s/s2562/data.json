(Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin or certain pain medications.)\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must provide support to improve drug overdose surveillance and reporting capabilities.\n\nHHS may support syringe exchange programs.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration must provide support to reduce drug overdose deaths.\n\nThis bill amends the Public Health Service Act to extend residential treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women.\n\nHHS must: (1) carry out a pilot program to support services for pregnant and postpartum women with a substance use disorder; (2) award grants to expand treatment activities in areas with a high rate of, or a rapid increase in, the use of opioids; (3) support increasing the capacity of substance use disorder services for adolescents; and (4) develop, expand, and enhance substance use recovery support services.\n\nThis bill amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and Internal Revenue Code to direct HHS and the Departments of Labor and the Treasury to require disclosures, issue guidance, conduct audits, and publish information regarding the requirement for group health plans and health insurance coverage to have parity between mental health and substance use disorder benefits and medical and surgical benefits. HHS must establish a consumer parity portal website.\n\nHHS must establish a loan repayment program for substance use disorder health professionals."
