DOJ must reduce the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Program funding for a state that fails to comply with benchmarks.\n\nThe bill amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to require each federal agency and department, including a federal court, to certify whether it has provided to the Federal Bureau of Investigation disqualifying records of persons prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm.\n\nIt amends the federal criminal code and the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 to define the terms \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" and \"committed to a mental institution.\"\n\nThe bill extends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act background check requirements to a transfer of a firearm between private parties by prohibiting such a transfer unless a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer has first taken possession of the firearm for the purpose of submitting a background check.\n\nA gun owner must report a lost or stolen firearm to DOJ and local law enforcement authorities within 48 hours of discovery."
