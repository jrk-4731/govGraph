This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate lower prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries for covered prescription drugs that CMS deems appropriate for negotiation based on: (1) program and per-beneficiary spending, (2) unit cost increases over the preceding years, (3) initial launch price, and (4) any other criteria determined by CMS.

CMS may negotiate lower prices on behalf of Medicare and MA beneficiaries for other covered prescription drugs, as well.</summary>
