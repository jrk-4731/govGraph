    "text": "Back the Blue Act of 2016\n\nThis bill amends the federal criminal code by establishing mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years in prison for offenders who kill, or attempt or conspire to kill, current or former U.S. judges and federal law enforcement officers. Offenders are subject to 30 years in prison or the death penalty if death results.\n\nAdditionally, the bill makes it illegal to kill, or attempt or conspire to kill, current or former public safety officers or judicial officers who work for state or local governments that are federally funded if the officers were engaged in official duties or targeted on account of their duties. The penalties for crimes against federal officials are also applied for crimes against federally funded public safety officers.\n\nThe bill: (1) makes it a crime to assault an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction, or enforcement of the laws of states; and (2) increases penalties based on the degree of bodily injury caused by the assault and the type of weapon used.\n\nA new federal crime is established for fleeing authorities to avoid prosecution, custody, or confinement after conviction for a killing, attempting to kill, or conspiring to kill, a federal judge or law enforcement officer, or a federally funded public safety officer.\n\nThe bill expands the authority of federal and state law enforcement officers to carry firearms in federal facilities.\n\nThe Department of Justice must award grants to state, local, or tribal enforcement agencies for improving their relationships with the communities they serve."
