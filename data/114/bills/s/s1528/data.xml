 This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) to carry out research to improve military vehicle technology to increase combat vehicle fuel economy or reduce fuel consumption.

DOD shall:

 establish an online, centralized repository for all DOD operational energy-related research and development efforts; conduct a program to develop and support projects designed to foster secure and reliable energy sources for military installations, including incorporation of advanced energy metering, renewable energy, energy storage, and redundant power systems; and develop associated cost and benefit metrics. The DOD Alternative Fuel Vehicle Infrastructure Fund is established in the Treasury to support installing and operating alternative fuel dispensing stations for DOD's alternative fueled vehicles and other related infrastructure.

 DOD shall:

 report on the costs and benefits associated with requiring 25% of National Guard and Reserve facilities to have at least a 21-day on-site power storage capacity to assist civil authorities in case of man-made or natural disasters; and submit a plan for integrating energy storage, micro-grid technologies, and on-site power generation systems at military installations at risk of power interruptions due to geographic location, dependence on connections to the electric grid, or other factors.</summary>
