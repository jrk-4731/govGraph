This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit to Congress and publish on the HHS website a report containing the results of a study concerning petroleum coke that includes: (1) an analysis of the public health and environmental impacts of the production, transportation, storage, and use of petroleum coke; (2) an assessment of potential approaches and best practices for storing, transporting, and managing petroleum coke; and (3) a quantitative analysis of current and projected domestic petroleum coke production and utilization locations.

The Environmental Protection Agency is required to promulgate rules concerning the storage and transportation of petroleum coke that ensure the protection of public and ecological health based upon the findings of such study.</summary>
