This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to award grants to state agencies responsible for administering funds received under the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant program, to local governments that have a high rate of, or have had a rapid increase in, the use of, or death related to the use of, heroin or other opioids (including prescription opioids), and to Indian tribes or tribal organizations in order to permit such entities to expand evidence-based treatment activities and related recovery services.

The Center shall award: (1) five-year grants to state substance abuse agencies, Indian tribes or tribal organizations, and public nonprofit entities to enhance access to primary care and related services for pregnant and parenting women diagnosed with opioid dependence; and (2) grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements of up to five years duration to eligible state substance abuse agencies and other appropriate entities to increase the capacity of substance use disorder treatment and recovery services for adolescents.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration shall award grants to state substance abuse agencies and non-profit organizations to develop, expand, and enhance recovery support services for individuals with substance use disorders.

The amount authorized under the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant program is increased: (1) to a specified amount for FY2016, and (2) by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for each subsequent year.

The Comptroller General shall evaluate and report on the in-patient and outpatient treatment capacity, availability, and needs of the United States.</summary>
