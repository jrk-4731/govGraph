  <summary date="2015-03-17T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">The Honest Scoring Act of 2015

This bill requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.

The CBO and the JCT must provide the estimates for legislation that has a budgetary effect exceeding $15 billion in any fiscal year before incorporating macroeconomic effects, or is designated as major legislation by either the Chairman of the House Budget Committee or the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. The CBO and the JCT must also continue to provide estimates of budgetary effects without macroeconomic effects.</summary>
