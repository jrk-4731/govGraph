 Repeals the National Technical Information Act of 1988, effective one year after the enactment of this Act (thus abolishes the National Technical Information Service [NTIS]).

Directs: (1) the Secretary of Commerce, the Archivist of the United States, the Comptroller General, and the Commissioner of Social Security to consult with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to determine if any NTIS function is critical to the U.S. economy; and (2) the Comptroller General to determine which of such critical functions are not being carried out by any other federal agency. Authorizes: (1) the Secretary of Commerce to transfer such critical functions to another office of the Department of Commerce, excluding any fee-based services offered by the NTIS; and (2) the General Services Administration or any federal agency receiving critical fee-based services from an NTIS contractor to enter into a new contract to continue such services. Terminates all other NTIS functions.

Requires the Secretary of Commerce to certify that all NTIS operations have been terminated. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) transfer all unexpended balances in the NTIS Revolving Fund to the Treasury general fund for the purpose of deficit reduction, and (2) dissolve such Fund.</summary>
