This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to categorize certain hearing aids as over-the-counter hearing aids and issue regulations regarding those hearing aids. The regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids must provide reasonable assurances of safety and efficacy and describe requirements for the sale of hearing aids in-person, by mail, or online, without a prescription.

State and local governments may not establish or continue in effect requirements for over-the-counter hearing aids that are not identical to FDA requirements.

Until the FDA updates its draft guidance regarding hearing aids, previous draft guidance is in effect.</summary>
