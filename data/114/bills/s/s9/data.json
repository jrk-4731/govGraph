The regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids must provide reasonable assurances of safety and efficacy and describe requirements for the sale of hearing aids in-person, by mail, or online, without a prescription.\n\nState and local governments may not establish or continue in effect requirements for over-the-counter hearing aids that are not identical to FDA requirements.\n\nUntil the FDA updates its draft guidance regarding hearing aids, previous draft guidance is in effect."
