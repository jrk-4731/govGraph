This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax treatment of retirement plans for small employers with no more than 100 employees. The bill: (1) increases from $500 to $5,000 the limit on the amount of the tax credit for small employer pension plan startup costs, and (2) allows a three-year $500 business-related tax credit for small employers that include and maintain an automatic contribution arrangement in an employer-sponsored retirement plan.

The bill also removes the 10% cap on the amount of an employee's wages that an employer may contribute to a retirement plan under an automatic contribution arrangement.</summary>
