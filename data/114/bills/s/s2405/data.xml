  <summary date="2015-12-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Meth Exposure to the Home Disclosure Act or the METH Disclosure Act

This bill directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency and any other federal agency with knowledge of methamphetamine-based hazards, to promulgate regulations meeting certain criteria for the disclosure of methamphetamine-based hazards in housing (other than newly constructed or never occupied housing) offered for sale or lease.

"Methamphetamine-based hazard" means any condition that causes exposure to any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine that would result in adverse human health effects.

HUD may carry out necessary investigations, and any U.S. district court within the jurisdiction of which one is carried out may issue orders for compliance with it.

The bill prescribes civil money penalties for violations of this Act.</summary>
