Priority is given to states with the highest health insurance premiums and such states may be provided bonus payments.\n\nStates must use grants to:\n\n reduce health insurance premiums through activities such as cost-sharing programs to reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses; increase the number of individuals with health insurance; review premium rates to determine unreasonable premium increases and facilitate reduction of such rates; and address health insurance affordability, quality, and accessibility through a waiver of health coverage requirements."
