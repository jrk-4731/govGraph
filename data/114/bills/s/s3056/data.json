(Under current law, a generic version of a medication with ETASU must join the brand name medication's system of ETASU unless the developer of the generic has a waiver from the Food and Drug Administration.) The bill does not apply to medications for which there is a shortage, unless the shortage will not be promptly resolved.\n\nIn a civil action regarding the availability of sufficient quantities of a medication, it is an affirmative defense that the license holder: (1) is not manufacturing or marketing the medication and does not have access to a supply of the medication to make available, or (2) sells the medication without restrictions through other entities and the developer can purchase sufficient quantities of the medication from those entities."
