  <summary date="2015-02-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Promoting Health as Youth Skills in Classrooms and Life Act

Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include health education and physical education in the definition of "core academic subjects."

Requires each state to determine the most feasible measure for assessing students in health education and physical education, including through adaptive assessments, to measure student knowledge and performance against state standards.

Authorizes appropriations for FY2016-FY2020 for the Carol M. White Physical Education Program, which provides matching grants to local educational agencies and community-based organizations to initiate, expand, and improve physical education programs (including after-school programs) for students in kindergarten through grade 12.</summary>
