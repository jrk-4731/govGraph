    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on August 30, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nOmnibus Territories Act of 2015 \n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1982, to eliminate the restriction on the use of resettlement and relocation funds by people of the Bikini Atoll for resettlement and relocation to areas only within the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe bill limits eligibility for the funds to Bikini people living on Kili and Ejit Islands, but they may use the funds to relocate and resettle outside the Marshall Islands. The use of resettlement funds is subject to the condition that the Department of the Interior submit to Congress a resettlement plan developed in coordination with the Bikini Atoll leadership.\n\nAnnual fiscal year expenditures from the resettlement fund may not exceed 90% of its average annual earnings for the preceding five years unless for resettlement purposes outside of the Marshall Islands.\n\n(Sec. 3) To provide and sustain air transportation in American Samoa between the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a, the Department of Transportation may renew a foreign air carrier's emergency air transportation exemption every 180 days (instead of the current 30-day renewal period that still applies to other areas).\n\n(Sec. 4) The bill amends the REAL ID Act of 2005 to provide that citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau who have been admitted as nonimmigrants pursuant to a Compact of Free Association are eligible for driver's licenses or personal identification cards."
