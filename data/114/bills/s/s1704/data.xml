(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Indian Tribal Justice Act to rename the office supporting tribal justice systems and courts to the Office of Tribal Justice System Support and Victim Services and to expand the purpose of the office to include providing services to crime victims.

The office must make grants to Indian tribes for crime victim compensation programs and services for crime victims, including: (1) domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, and child advocacy centers; (2) relocation and transitional housing; (3) medical care; and (4) legal services. These grants may also fund programs designed to improve the handling of violent crime cases, housing for law enforcement officers, and the renovation of facilities used for providing services to crime victims. Grant recipients must report annually on how the grant was used.

The bill amends the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to make 5% of the Crime Victims Fund available for these grants.</summary>
