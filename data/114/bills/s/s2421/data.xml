(Sec. 1) This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convey to the Tanana Tribal Council in Tanana, Alaska, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to certain property (including all land, improvements, and appurtenances) containing 11.25 acres, in the village of Tanana for use in connection with health and social services programs.

The bill states that this conveyance by warranty deed shall supersede and render of no future effect any quitclaim deed to the property executed by HHS and the Council.

 This conveyance: (1) shall be made by warranty deed; and (2) shall not require any consideration from the Council for the property, impose any obligation, term, or condition on the Council, or allow for any U.S. reversionary interest in the property.

 The Council shall not be liable for soil, surface water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the disposal, release, or presence of environmental contamination (including oil or petroleum products, hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, pollutants, toxic substances, solid waste, or any other environmental contamination or hazard under any federal or Alaska law).

 HHS shall be accorded any easement or access to the conveyed property as may be necessary to satisfy any retained obligations and liability.

 HHS shall comply with requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 respecting certain deeds for the transfer of U.S.-owned real property on which any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, disposed of, or known to have been released.

(Sec. 2) HHS shall convey to the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation in Dillingham, Alaska, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to certain property included in the Dental Annex Subdivision (including all land, improvements, and appurtenances) containing 1.474 acres more or less, also for use in connection with health and social services programs.

The bill states that this conveyance by warranty deed shall supersede and render of no future effect any quitclaim deed to the property executed by HHS and the Corporation.

 This conveyance: (1) shall be made by warranty deed; and (2) shall not require any consideration from the Corporation for the property, impose any obligation, term, or condition on the Corporation, or allow for any U.S. reversionary interest in the property.

 The Corporation shall not be liable for soil, surface water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the disposal, release, or presence of environmental contamination (including oil or petroleum products, hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, pollutants, toxic substances, solid waste, or any other environmental contamination or hazard under any federal or Alaska law).

 HHS shall be accorded any easement or access to the conveyed property as may be necessary to satisfy any retained obligations and liability.
