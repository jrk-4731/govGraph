The initiative must: (1) coordinate with agencies, academic institutions, and others to improve and update existing information on the biomedical research workforce, and (2) take into consideration the recommendations of the National Academies of Sciences regarding the next generation of researchers and report on actions taken based on those recommendations.\n\n(Sec. 3) The bill revises loan repayment programs for health professionals conducting research to increase the maximum repayment amount and to give the NIH the authority to expand eligibility for the programs based on workforce and scientific priorities.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on NIH efforts to attract, retain, and develop emerging scientists."
