(The Pass is currently made available at no charge to, and for the lifetime of, any U.S. citizen or person domiciled in the United States who has been medically determined to be permanently disabled.)

Requires the entrance fees charged those who do not have a free National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass to be adjusted to maintain total receipts.</summary>
