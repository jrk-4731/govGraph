This bill establishes the Government Transformation Board, which shall:

 review programs and conduct research to determine whether the organizational practices, operations, and reform efforts of federal agencies are useful, duplicative, efficient, effective, and economical; develop and maintain approved criteria for the selection, prioritization, and scheduling of such reviews; analyze organizational practices and management challenges of federal agencies; identify best practices of federal agencies and opportunities for such agencies to share methods, tools, systems, and technologies; coordinate input from appropriate federal agencies and provide opportunities for the Board to accept ideas on improving government performance; upon request, provide information on Board activities to the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, other federal agencies, the Office of the Inspector General of each federal agency, and specified congressional committees; conduct post-transformation follow-up reviews; serve as a repository for best practices and successful processes, systems, and technologies for federal agencies; provide training and education to federal employees who are on detail to the Board about program improvement, government transformation, efficiency, and effectiveness; review program assessments performed by federal agencies; and maintain data privacy and security. The Board shall submit semiannual reports on its activities, including its suggestions for implementing the best practices of federal agencies and recommendations for improvement or investment in federal programs or elimination, reduction, or consolidation of federal programs.

The Board shall submit: (1) specific recommendations, after completion of a program assessment, for the improvement of the effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of the program; and (2) biannual reports on historical data and trends in the information studied by the Board.

The Board shall terminate on September 30 of the sixth fiscal year beginning after enactment of this Act.
