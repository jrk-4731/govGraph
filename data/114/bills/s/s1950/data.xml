  <summary date="2015-08-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to direct the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to: (1) develop an online voter registration application platform; and (2) forward automatically completed online voter registration application forms and cancellation requests to the appropriate chief state election officials and, acting through such officials, to appropriate state and local election officials in the state.

The EAC shall automatically connect registration applicants to the state platform in lieu of the federal platform in any state that has developed one meeting the requirements of this Act.

A state may require a first-time voter registered online to vote in person.

The Postmaster General shall ensure that the U.S. Postal Service Online Change of Address process incorporates the online voter registration platform and allows individuals to register to vote during the process.

The Act is amended with respect to administration of voter registration to change the voter registration application deadline from the lesser of 30 days or the period provided by state law before the date of election to the lesser of 28 days or the period provided by state law.</summary>
