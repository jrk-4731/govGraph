The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nIndian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act of 2015\n\n (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 to rename the Act to the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Act of 1992 and to revise the program that provides for the integration of employment, training, and related services programs for Indian tribes.\n\n(Sec. 6) The bill revises the types of programs that may be integrated. (Sec. 8) The bill revises the process for: (1) federal agencies to grant or deny a tribe's request to waive statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirements to efficiently implement an integration plan; and (2) the Department of the Interior to approve or disapprove an integration plan. A tribe is granted certain hearing and appeal rights if Interior disapproves its plan.\n\n (Sec. 10) Tribal authority to use funds to place participants in training positions with employers is revised.\n\n (Sec. 13) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must receive and distribute funds for use in accordance with an approved integration plan.\n\n(Sec. 14) Funds transferred to a tribe must be treated as non-federal funds for purposes of meeting matching requirements. Civil liability limitations apply to approved integration plans."
