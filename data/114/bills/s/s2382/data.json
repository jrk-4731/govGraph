    "text": "Strengthening Medicare Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to revise requirements related\u00a0the approval of\u00a0intensive cardiac rehabilitation programs by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for purposes of Medicare coverage.\n\nTo be approved by CMS as an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program under current law, a program\u00a0must show that it: (1) positively affected the progression of coronary heart disease or reduced the need for either coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary interventions, and (2) accomplished a significant reduction in other specified health measures. The bill instead requires a program to show that it: (1) reversed the progression of coronary heart disease or reduced the need for coronary bypass surgery; and (2) accomplished, in addition to a significant reduction in other specified health measures, a significant increase in the measure of blood flow to the heart. The bill further requires a program to show,\u00a0using\u00a0research of its own program,\u00a0that\u00a0these measures were accomplished\u00a0by lifestyle changes alone.\n\nThe bill removes the specific requirement that such a program be \"physician-supervised\" but retains other existing requirements for program supervision.\n\nA\u00a0program that was approved by CMS as an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program prior to August 1, 2015, shall be deemed to have met these requirements.\n\nTo be eligible for an intensive cardiac rehabilitation program under current law, an individual must have had one of several specified conditions or interventions. The bill adds to the list of qualifying conditions: (1) stable, chronic heart failure; and (2) any additional condition that CMS determines shall be covered under such a program."
