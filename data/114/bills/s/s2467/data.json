AHRQ must establish a pilot program to test collection and reporting of health care-associated infections data by additional health facilities.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must support: (1) state-based collaboratives implementing infection prevention, control, and surveillance; and (2) state medical boards that require health care professionals to complete coursework or training in patient safety topics.\n\nThis bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) and title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require participating hospitals to: (1) transmit information about a patient's infection to the patient and the patient's other health care providers, and (2) require new members of a participating hospital's board to receive training on patient safety topics.\n\nThe CDC must: (1) issue an electronic form for providers to use to transmit information about infections, and (2) support and conduct antibiotic stewardship activities.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must require that acute care hospitals report antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance.\n\nPatient safety organizations may collect patient-reported information. AHRQ must research best practices for enabling this collection of information and establish a public website to access data from the network of patient safety databases."
