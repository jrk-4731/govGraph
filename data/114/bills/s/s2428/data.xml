This bill amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 to direct the Corporation for National and Community Service to establish the National Service for Schools Program to carry out activities concerning a Service Opportunity Registry that shall list eligible service opportunities and the registered organizations that offer them.

Upon receiving an application from an organization that offers an eligible service opportunity, the Corporation shall register it in a specified manner, including a description of the eligible service opportunity in the Registry.

To be eligible to participate in and receive credit for service in a service opportunity listed in the Registry, qualified students must apply to their participating State Commission on National and Community Service.

Each organization shall:

 record the qualifying hours of service completed by each qualified student who participates in a service opportunity; and notify the appropriate State Commission at least annually of the number of qualifying hours of service completed by each qualified student on a service opportunity. Eligible students shall receive an award of $10,000 from the National Services for Schools Account (established by this bill) for use to:

 repay eligible student loans, or pay all or part of the cost of attendance or other educational expenses at an institution of higher education.</summary>
