The bill sets forth procedures and time periods for congressional introduction, expedited consideration, amendments, and points of order for the joint resolution.\n\nThe sponsor of the joint resolution must exclude, and it shall be out of order for the Senate or the House of Representatives to consider, provisions that: (1) are unnecessary to eliminate or consolidate programs in GAO-identified actions or areas of duplication, (2) are not germane to the GAO report, or (3) affect direct spending.\n\nIn the Senate, the joint resolution shall be agreed to only upon an affirmative three-fifths vote.\n\nThe bill provides procedures for the coordination of consideration between chambers and the consideration of presidential vetoes of such joint resolutions."
