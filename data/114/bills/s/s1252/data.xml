Global Food Security Act of 2016 

This bill requires the President to develop and implement a Global Food Security Strategy to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition.

(Sec. 3) This section specifies that it is in the U.S. national interest to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans through programs and activities that:

 place food insecure countries on a path toward self-sufficiency and economic freedom by coordinating U.S. assistance programs; accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition; increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of small-scale producers; build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable populations and households while reducing reliance upon emergency food assistance; create an environment for agricultural growth and investment; improve the nutritional status of women and children; demonstrably meet, align with, and leverage U.S strategies and investments in trade, economic growth, national security, science and technology, agriculture research and extension, maternal and child health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene; strengthen partnerships between U.S. and foreign universities that build agricultural capacity; and ensure the effective use of taxpayer dollars in furthering these objectives. (Sec. 4) This section sets forth definitions that apply to this bill.

(Sec. 5) The President must coordinate a whole-of-government strategy to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans.

This section specifies required goals and criteria for the strategy. The President must coordinate the efforts of federal departments and agencies to implement the strategy by establishing:

 monitoring and evaluation systems, coherence, and coordination across federal departments and agencies; linkages with other initiatives and strategies of federal departments and agencies; and platforms for regular consultation and collaboration with key stakeholders and congressional committees. The President must submit the strategy, including agency-specific plans, to Congress by October 1, 2016.

(Sec. 6) To carry out the strategy, the President may provide assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prevent or address food shortages.

(Sec. 7) This section states that it is U.S. policy to fully leverage, enhance, and expand the impact and reach of available U.S. humanitarian resources to mitigate the effects of manmade and natural disasters by utilizing innovative new approaches to delivering aid.

This section amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide emergency food assistance (including funds, transfers, vouchers, and agricultural commodities) acquired through local or regional procurement to meet emergency food needs arising from manmade and natural disasters.

The President must report annually to Congress on the use of this authority, including the amounts of assistance provided, intended beneficiaries, monitoring and evaluation strategies, anticipated outcomes, and actual outcomes.

(Sec. 8) The President must report to Congress on the implementation of the Global Food Security Strategy for 2017 and 2018.

The Office of Management and Budget must submit to Congress an interagency budget crosscut report including specified details regarding the proposed and actual expenditures of individual agencies for global food security activities.

(Sec. 9) This section specifies that nothing in the Global Food Security Strategy or this bill should be construed to supersede or otherwise affect the authority of federal departments and agencies to carry out specified food and nutrition security or emergency and nonemergency food assistance programs.</summary>
