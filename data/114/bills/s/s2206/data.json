Those policies must include procedures for reporting incidents, including those occurring after-hours, at sea, or in remote locations.\n\nNOAA must: (1) ensure that at least one of its employees who handle matters relating to equal employment opportunity or sexual harassment is stationed in each of its regions of operation and in each of its marine and aviation centers, (2) establish victim advocates to aid victims of sexual assault, and (3) submit an annual report on sexual assaults.\n\nThe bill establishes protections for victims, including through a change of duty station of an alleged perpetrator.\n\n(Sec.201)The bill revises the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Act of 2002. The bill sets forth new requirements under that Act concerning obligated service requirements, training and physical fitness, education loan assistance, recruitment, hiring and promotions, and other workforce issues.\n\nNOAA must develop and implement a charter vessel safety policy applicable to the acquisition by NOAA of charter vessel services.\n\n (Sec.301) The bill revises and reauthorizes through FY2020 the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998."
