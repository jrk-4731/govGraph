The FDA must issue guidance on demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of such drugs. The FDA's determination of the safety and effectiveness of such a drug must reflect the drug's use in the intended limited population.\n\nThe label and prescribing information of such a drug must indicate that the drug has been approved for use only in a limited population. The sponsor of such a drug must submit promotional materials for the drug to the FDA prior to dissemination. The FDA may remove these requirements for such a drug that is approved for broader use.\n\nThe FDA must report the number of requests for approval and the number of approvals of such drugs. The Government Accountability Office must report on activities to combat antimicrobial resistance and the limited population drug approval process established by this bill."
