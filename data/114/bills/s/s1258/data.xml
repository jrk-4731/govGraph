This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish certain programs to support distributed energy systems, which are energy sources and systems that: (1) produce electric or thermal energy close to the point of use using renewable energy resources or waste thermal energy, (2) generate electricity using a combined heat and power system, (3) distribute electricity in microgrids, (4) store electric or thermal energy, or (5) distribute or transfer thermal energy to building heating and cooling systems through a district energy system. DOE must establish: (1) a loan program to provide funding for deploying distributed energy systems to states and other government entities, institutions of higher education, and electric utilities; and (2) a technical assistance and grant program to disseminate information and provide technical assistance to nonprofit and profit entities for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing distributed energy systems.</summary>
