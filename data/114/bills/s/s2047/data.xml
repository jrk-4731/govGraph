This bill prohibits the Department of Commerce from requiring sectors of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery to comply with the independent, third-party monitoring program, unless the program is fully funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The program monitors annual catch limits for fishing vessels in that sector. Currently, those sectors are required to develop and implement those programs, and are responsible for the program costs.</summary>
