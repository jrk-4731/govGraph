  <summary date="2015-08-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill: (1) reaffirms the trust status of land taken into trust by the United States under the Indian Reorganization Act before enactment of this Act for an Indian tribe that was federally recognized on the date the land was taken into trust, and (2) ratifies and confirms any action of the Department of the Interior in acquiring and taking land into trust under such Act as if the action had been specifically authorized and directed by prior Act of Congress.

Any land taken into trust that has been ratified and confirmed by this Act shall remain Indian country.

This bill shall apply to all claims (including claims challenging the validity of title or the effectiveness of any action of Interior acquiring and taking land into trust) pending on, or filed on or after, the date of the enactment of this Act.</summary>
