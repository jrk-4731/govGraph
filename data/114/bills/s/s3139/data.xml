This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to expand the tax credit for investment in energy property to include qualified high-efficiency linear generator property.

A stationary linear generator power plant is an integrated system consisting of translators, cylinders, electricity generating equipment, and associated balance of plant components which converts a fuel or waste heat into electricity for stationary applications. Qualified high-efficiency linear generator property is a stationary linear generator power plant which has: (1) a nameplate capacity of less than 2,000 kilowatts, and (2) an electricity-only generation efficiency of greater than 30%.

For high-efficiency linear generator property that is placed in service during the taxable year, the credit for the year may not exceed $1,500 for each 0.5 kilowatt of capacity of the property.</summary>
