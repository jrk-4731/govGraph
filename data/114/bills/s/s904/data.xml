Craft Beverage Bond Simplification Act of 2015 

(Sec. 2) This bill allows taxpayers who are liable for not more than $50,000 per year in excise taxes on distilled spirits, wine, or beer to file and pay such taxes quarterly without the requirement to post a bond covering the operations and withdrawals of such distilled spirits, wines, or beer. The bill also allows such a taxpayer who reasonably expects to have a tax liability of not more than $1,000 per year and who was liable for not more than $1,000 in taxes in the preceding calendar year to file and pay such taxes annually rather than quarterly. Makes this Act effective 90 days after its enactment.</summary>
