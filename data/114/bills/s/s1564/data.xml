  <summary date="2015-06-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act

This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to require specified employers (including certain federal and state employers) who employ at least 15 employees at any time during a calendar year to provide each eligible employee at least 10 days of paid vacation time during each 12-month period, to be used on consecutive or nonconsecutive days.

An employee is eligible for paid vacation time only if he or she has been employed by the employer for at least one year and has worked at least 1,250 hours for that employer during the previous year.

The employee must give the employer at least 15 days' prior notice of his or her intent to take paid vacation, including the dates it will begin and end.

The Department of Labor shall conduct a public awareness campaign, through the Internet and other media, to inform the public of an eligible employee's entitlement to paid vacation time under the Act.</summary>
