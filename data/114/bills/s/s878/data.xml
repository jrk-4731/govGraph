  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to require the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a voluntary loan program to provide support to a state, territory, and tribal organization (eligible entity) in establishing or expanding programs that provide financing to residential property owners or tenants (recipient households) for energy efficiency upgrades of residential buildings.

DOE must establish favorable terms for a loan provided to an eligible entity. An eligible entity shall use a loan to establish or expand one or more financing programs that: (1) enable recipient households to undertake residential energy efficiency upgrades, (2) may require an outlay of capital by recipient households, and (3) incorporate a consumer-friendly repayment approach.

To offset the cost of this bill, the bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to decrease the authorization of appropriations for the Zero Net Energy Commercial Buildings Initiative for FY2016-FY2018.</summary>
