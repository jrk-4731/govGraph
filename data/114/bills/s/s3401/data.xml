This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should remain the primary means by which eligible veterans access health care, and (2) the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) needs a simple tool by which it can send veterans into the community to receive health care when appropriate.

The bill establishes the Care in the Community Program to furnish specified hospital care and medical services to eligible veterans through certain individuals and entities, including through the use of contracts or agreements.

The VA shall: (1) administer the program through its Non-VA Care Coordination Program, and (2) establish an interdisciplinary panel to assist in developing a new clinical appeals process for resolving VA health care disputes.

The Government Accountability Office shall report on: (1) clinical operations of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), (2) the VA travel benefits program, (3) management of the VA's Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, and (4) payment by the VA for health care furnished to veterans through non-VA health care providers.

The bill repeals specified authorities for emergency treatment reimbursement and contracts for care in non-VA facilities.

The bill establishes in the VHA a Payment and Access Commission, which shall: (1) review and make recommendations to Congress regarding VHA policies and regulations affecting veterans health care access, including topics affected by the Care in the Community Program; and (2) create an early-warning system to identify provider shortage areas.</summary>
