  <summary date="2015-10-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Hide No Harm Act of 2015

This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime for a business entity or business executive to knowingly conceal information about its business practices or products that pose an imminent risk of death or serious physical injury to consumers and workplace danger.

 Specific requirements are set forth for what a business entity or business executive must do after acquiring knowledge of a serious danger associated with its business practices or products. If such an entity or executive fails to warn affected employees and other individuals of a serious danger, they are subject to a fine and/or prison term of five years.

The bill makes it unlawful to knowingly discriminate or retaliate against an employee (i.e., a whistleblower) who warns other agencies or individuals of a serious danger associated with a product or service.</summary>
