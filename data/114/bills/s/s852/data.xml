This bill makes unenforceable any agreement between an employer and an employee to arbitrate a dispute with respect to a tort claim arising out of rape.

This declaration applies to:

 any "employer" engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks (excluding the United States, a corporation owned by the U.S. government, or any agency of the District of Columbia subject to competitive service, or a bona fide private membership club [other than a labor organization] which is exempt from federal taxation); and any "employee" except individuals elected to state public office, personal staff of such an officer, or policy-making appointees or immediate advisers to the office.</summary>
