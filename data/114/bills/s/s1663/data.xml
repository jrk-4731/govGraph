  <summary date="2015-06-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Robert Matava Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2015

This bill amends the federal criminal code to expand the prohibition on telemarketing fraud to include "telemarketing or email marketing" fraud. It expands the definition of telemarketing or email marketing to include measures to induce investment for financial profit, participation in a business opportunity, or commitment to a loan.

The legislation applies enhanced criminal penalties to telemarketing or email marketing fraud that targets or victimizes persons over age 55. It also expands the fraud offenses subject to enhanced penalties to include health care fraud.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) must identify, collect, and publish data annually related to the incidence of elder abuse. The Department of Health and Human Services must provide for publication data on the number of elder abuse cases referred to adult protective services.

The bill requires DOJ to establish a grant program for states to develop, establish, and operate programs to improve the response to, investigation of, and prosecution of elder abuse cases. DOJ must also provide information, training, and technical assistance to help states and local governments investigate, prosecute, prevent, and mitigate the impact of elder abuse, exploitation, and neglect.

It grants congressional consent to any two or more states to enter into cooperative agreements or compacts to promote and to enforce laws to promote the safety and well-being of elders. The legislation requires the State Justice Institute to submit legislative proposals to Congress to facilitate such agreements and compacts.

The Government Accountability Office must review and report findings on the financial cost of elder abuse and exploitation to the federal government.</summary>
