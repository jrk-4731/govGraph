This bill directs the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to establish a test program to allow states to enter into interstate compacts with contiguous states, approved by the governor of each state, to standardize the requirements for drivers operating commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce.

A commercial driver's license issued by one state participating in a compact shall be recognized as valid in every state participating in the compact.

Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit or change the authority to operate in interstate commerce for drivers over age 21, including by setting the minimum age requirement to receive a Class A commercial driver's license at age 18.</summary>
