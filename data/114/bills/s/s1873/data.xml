(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), for each major border security technology acquisition program, to:

 ensure that it has a written acquisition program baseline approved by the relevant acquisition decision authority; document that it is meeting cost, schedule, and performance thresholds in compliance with departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and have a plan for meeting program implementation objectives by managing contractor performance. "Major acquisition program" means a DHS acquisition program estimated to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300 million (based on FY2015 constant dollars) over its life cycle cost.

Through the Under Secretary for Management and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), DHS shall ensure that border security technology acquisition program managers adhere to internal control standards identified by the Government Accountability Office. CBP shall provide information to assist the Under Secretary monitor program management.

The Under Secretary shall submit a plan to Congress for border security technology testing and evaluation so that such new technologies are evaluated through a series of assessments, processes, and audits to ensure compliance with departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as well as the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars.

(Sec. 3) No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act.</summary>
