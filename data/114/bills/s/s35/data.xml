 (Sec. 4) Extends federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana.

(Sec. 5) Makes the Tribe and each member eligible for all services and benefits provided by the United States to Indians and federally recognized Indian tribes, without regard to the existence of a reservation for the Tribe or the location of the residence of any member on or near an Indian reservation. Considers the federal service area of the Tribe to be the area comprised of Blaine, Cascade, Glacier, and Hill Counties, Montana.

 (Sec. 7) Directs the Tribe, as a condition of receiving recognition, services, and benefits pursuant to this Act, to submit to the Department of the Interior a membership roll consisting of the name of each individual enrolled as a member of the Tribe. Requires the Tribe to maintain such membership roll.

(Sec. 8) Directs Interior to acquire, for the benefit of the Tribe, trust title to 200 acres of land within the Tribe's service area to be used for a tribal land base. Allows Interior to acquire additional land for the benefit of the Tribe.</summary>
