    "text": "Rebuilding and Renewing Rural America Act of 2016 \n\nThis bill modifies: (1) tax and regulatory policies that affect certain rural communities, and (2) tax rules that apply to private foundations.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to program-related investments made by private foundations for a charitable purpose, to:\n\n modify the definition of and requirements for program-related investments; allow a declaratory judgment remedy to determine whether investments in any entity are program-related investments; expand reporting requirements for for-profit entities that receive program-related investments; and allow public inspection of petitions seeking a determination of program-related investment status and annual information returns. The bill also includes several tax provisions that apply to rural renewal communities, which are low-income communities that: (1) have a population of at least 200 people but not more than 25,000 people, and are not located in a metropolitan area which has a population of 200,000 or more; or (2) are entirely within an Indian reservation.\n\nWith respect to such communities, the bill:\n\n allows tax credits for a portion of the costs of reducing lead, radon, or asbestos hazards in rural commercial structures; expands the new markets tax credit; allows expensing of certain depreciable business assets; reduces payroll taxes; and allows tax-preferred rural renewal community business start-up savings accounts. Reducing Excessive Government in Rural America Act of 2016 \n\nCongress must consider legislation to reduce the regulatory cost to rural America by at least 10% over 10 years by repealing certain regulations. The legislation must be considered using expedited legislative procedures specified in the bill."
