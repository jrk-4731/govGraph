    "text": "This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by requiring small or medium public water systems to sample their tap water for lead and copper in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) monitoring requirements under the national primary drinking water regulations until the system: (1) exceeds the regulation's lead or copper limits, or (2) becomes eligible for reduced monitoring. Small or medium water systems that exceed the lead and copper limits must carry out certain corrosion control treatment steps by specified deadlines.\n\nPublic water systems must notify their customers of lead concentration levels in drinking water when the lead levels exceed those regulatory limits or when the EPA determines the lead concentration warrants notice. The EPA must notify the public about those lead concentrations by a certain deadline if the public water system or the state does not do so. The EPA may notify customers of a public water system or the local or state health department of the result of lead monitoring conducted by a public water system.\n\nStates must provide a short-term remedy, including bottled water or a water filtration system, to each affected household when a public water system exceeds lead limits or when the EPA determines the lead concentration warrants notice.\n\nEach state must post online the annual consumer confidence report of each community water system."
