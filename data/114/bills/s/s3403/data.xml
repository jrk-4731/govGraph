This bill authorizes payment by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the costs associated with service by Veterans Health Administration medical residents and interns at facilities operated by Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or the Indian Health Service (covered facilities).

The bill requires the VA to carry out a pilot program to establish graduate medical education residency training programs at such facilities that have an existing reimbursement agreement with the VA under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and that are located in rural or remote areas, including at one facility in each of Alaska and Montana. The VA shall reimburse each covered facility participating in the program for costs of:

 curriculum development; recruitment, training, and retention of residents and faculty; accreditation of programs of education; faculty salaries; and certain other expenses relating to providing medical education under the program. Each medical resident who participates in the program must agree to two years of obligated service at a covered facility or a VA facility for each year in the program. A program participant who fails to satisfy the period of obligated service shall be liable to the United States for prorated portion of the amount paid for program participation.

A medical resident who participates in the program shall be eligible for participation in the Indian Health Service Loan Repayment Program.</summary>
