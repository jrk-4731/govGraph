 Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require each Medicare participating hospital to implement a hospital-wide staffing plan for nursing services furnished in the hospital.

Requires each participating hospital to establish a hospital nurse staffing committee which shall implement such plan.
