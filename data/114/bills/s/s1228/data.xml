  <summary date="2015-05-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">North American Energy Infrastructure Act

Prohibits any person from constructing, connecting, operating, or maintaining a cross-border segment of an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility at the national boundary of the United States for the import or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity to or from Canada or Mexico without obtaining a certificate of crossing under this Act.

Requires the Department of State, with respect to oil pipelines, or the Department of Energy (DOE), with respect to electric transmission facilities, to issue a certificate of crossing for the cross-border segment within 120 days after final action is taken under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, unless it is not in U.S. public interest.

Directs DOE, as a condition of issuing a certificate, to require that the cross-border segment be constructed, connected, operated, or maintained consistent with specified policies and standards.

Amends the Natural Gas Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve within 30 days after receipt any application for the importation or exportation of natural gas to or from Canada or Mexico.

 Declares that no presidential permit shall be necessary for the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of an oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility, including any cross-border segment.</summary>
