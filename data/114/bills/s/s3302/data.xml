This bill establishes and provides funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Emergency Response Fund. The CDC may use this fund when emergency operations are activated in response to a public health emergency or potential public health emergency. Funds may be used to detect, prepare for, or respond to public health threats domestically and abroad.

The CDC may not use amounts over a specified threshold in a fiscal year until 30 days after it notifies Congress and the President of its plan to use those amounts. A joint resolution of Congress may prohibit the CDC from using those amounts.</summary>
