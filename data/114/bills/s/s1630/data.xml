This bill amends the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 to make it an unlawful labor practice for a labor organization or its agents while representing, or seeking to represent, employees engaged in maritime employment to engage in a labor slowdown at any time, including when a collective-bargaining agreement is in effect.

In cases where a labor organization has committed a violation, the National Labor Relations Board shall:

 revoke the organization's exclusive recognition or certification to represent the employees in the bargaining unit, or take other appropriate disciplinary action.</summary>
