This bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to prescribe regulations to provide for the reimbursement of federal employees traveling on official business for the use of a transportation network company or an innovative mobility technology company. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall prescribe such regulations regarding the reimbursement of judicial branch employees.

An "innovative mobility technology company" is an entity that applies technology to expand and enhance available transportation choices, better manage demand for transportation services, and provide alternatives to driving alone. A "transportation network company" is an entity that uses a digital network to connect riders to drivers.

Each agency shall submit to the General Services Administration (GSA) by November 31 of each year an analysis of the total costs of transportation service by type and of the total number of trips using each transportation type for official travel.

By January 31 of each year, the GSA shall submit to the OMB and specified congressional committees:

 an examination of the data and analyses on employee travel and transportation submitted by specified federal departments and agencies with Chief Financial Officers, a survey of such data and analyses for other agencies, and a description of any regulations or changes in employee travel and transportation regulations promulgated during the previous year.</summary>
