  <summary date="2016-03-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Advancing Medical Resident Training in Community Hospitals Act of 2016

This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to&#160;revise payment rules for graduate medical education (GME) costs with respect to a hospital that establishes a new medical residency training program.

With respect to a hospital that has not entered into a GME affiliation agreement, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) shall establish the hospital's full-time equivalent (FTE) resident amount only after determining that the hospital's medical residency training program trains more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period. In the case of a hospital with an approved FTE resident amount based on the training of no more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period before October 1, 1997, or 3.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period after that date, CMS shall provide the hospital an opportunity to have its FTE resident amount reestablished when the hospital begins&#160;training FTE residents&#160;in excess of&#160;the&#160;applicable threshold.

Current law limits the number, subject to&#160;the application of&#160;certain adjustments,&#160;of FTE residents a hospital may have in allopathic and osteopathic medicine for purposes of Medicare payment. The bill specifies that CMS shall determine a hospital's&#160;limitation&#160;adjustment only after determining that the hospital's medical residency training program trains&#160;more than 1.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period. In the case of a hospital with a limitation adjustment based on the training of no more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period before October 1, 1997, or 3.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period after that date, CMS shall provide the hospital an opportunity to have its&#160;adjustment re-determined&#160;when the hospital begins&#160;training FTE residents&#160;in excess of&#160;the&#160;applicable threshold.</summary>
