For FY2017 and each fiscal year thereafter, DOD shall obligate for eligible program technologies a minimum of 1% of the aggregate DOD research, development, test, and evaluation budget available for projects and activities at the level of Advanced Component Development Prototypes and above.

DOD shall: (1) provide Congress with annual project briefings, and (2) issue additional program operations guidelines.
