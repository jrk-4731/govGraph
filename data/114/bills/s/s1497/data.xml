  <summary date="2015-06-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to exempt Indian health facilities and services, programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and programs under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.</summary>
