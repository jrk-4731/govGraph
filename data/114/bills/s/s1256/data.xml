This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish certain energy storage programs.

The bill establishes a program for the research of energy storage systems within DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.

DOE must establish a loan program to provide loans to states and other government entities, educational institutions, and electric utilities for: (1) the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in a specific project, and (2) programs to finance the demonstration and deployment of multiple energy storage systems through a financial assistance program. Loans may only be used to fund programs relating to the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities.

DOE must establish a technical assistance and grant program to: (1) disseminate information and provide technical assistance directly to nonprofit or for-profit entities so those entities can identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems; and (2) make grants to such entities so that they may contract to obtain technical assistance to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems.</summary>
