(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to revise details of the Cooper Spur-Government Camp land exchange between the United States and Oregon.

After the final appraised value of the federal and nonfederal lands is determined and approved by Department of Agriculture (USDA), the USDA shall not be required to reappraise or update such value for a period of up to three years, unless the condition of any of the lands is significantly and substantially altered by fire, windstorm, or other events.

It is the intent of Congress that the land exchange be completed within one year of this Act's enactment.

Conveyance conditions are revised regarding reservation of a conservation easement for the protection of an identified wetland, reservation of a nonexclusive trail easement, and equalization of values of the exchange properties.</summary>
