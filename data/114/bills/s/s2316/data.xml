  <summary date="2015-11-19T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to reissue veterans benefits to a beneficiary in all cases of fiduciary misuse.

The VA shall pay the beneficiary or the successor fiduciary an amount equal to the misused benefits.

 VA access to fiduciary-held financial accounts shall be increased by requiring any fiduciary to authorize the VA to obtain any financial record held by an institution regarding the fiduciary or the beneficiary whenever the VA determines that such record is necessary:

 for the administration of a VA program; or to safeguard the beneficiary's benefits against neglect, misappropriation, embezzlement, or fraud.</summary>
