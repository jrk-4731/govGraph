(Scleroderma and fibrosis are connective tissue conditions that cause hardening or scarring of skin and organs.)\n\nThe commission must develop a long-term, comprehensive plan for scleroderma and fibrosis research. The plan must: (1) prioritize research that has cross-cutting value and requires coordination across NIH, and (2) include specific steps for implementation of the research.\n\nThe commission must establish working groups to make research recommendations for the various organs and systems impacted by fibrotic illness.\n\nThe commission must be terminated not later than two years after establishment.\n\nThe NIAMS must create the Scleroderma and Fibrosis Working Group to oversee and assist with implementation of the long-term plan."
