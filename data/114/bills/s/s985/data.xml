  <summary date="2015-04-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">United States Coast Guard Commemorative Coin Act

 Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue in commemoration of the United States Coast Guard: (1) $5 gold coins, (2) $1 silver coins, and (3) half-dollar clad coins.

Requires the design of such coins to be emblematic of the traditions, history, and heritage of the Coast Guard, and its role in securing our nation since 1790.

Prescribes design requirements.

Restricts the issuance of such coins to the one-year period beginning on January 1, 2018.

Prescribes the sale price of the coins and coin surcharges. Requires such surcharges to be paid by the Secretary to the National Coast Guard Museum Association to help finance the design and construction of the National Coast Guard Museum.

Directs the Secretary to ensure that minting and issuing coins under this Act will not result in any net cost to the federal government.</summary>
