This bill amends federal bankruptcy law to allow a medically distressed debtor to exempt, from the property of the estate in bankruptcy, up to $250,000 of the debtor's aggregate interest in: (1) specified real or personal property that the debtor or debtor's dependent uses as a residence, (2) a cooperative that owns such property, or (3) a burial plot for the debtor or debtor's dependent.

With respect to a medically distressed debtor, the bill waives certain administrative and procedural requirements.

In addition, the bill allows&#160;a medically distressed debtor to discharge in bankruptcy debts for certain educational loans.

A debtor who seeks relief as a medically distressed debtor must attest in writing, under penalty of perjury, that the debtor's medical expenses are genuine and were not specifically incurred to bring the debtor within the meaning of "medically distressed debtor."</summary>
