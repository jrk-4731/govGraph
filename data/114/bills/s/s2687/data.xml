(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to require a grant-receiving state plan for a child abuse or neglect prevention and treatment program to include policies and procedures requiring systems to monitor the multidisciplinary plan of safe care for an infant born affected by substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in order to:

 ensure the safety and well-being of children; address the health, including mental health and substance use disorder treatment, needs of the child, and of the family or affected caregiver, involved; and determine whether and to what extent local entities are capable of providing referrals to and delivery of appropriate services for the child and family. (Sec. 3) Each grant-receiving state shall work annually with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to produce a report including the total number of infants identified and the number of infants for whom a plan of safe care was developed.

(Sec. 4) HHS shall: (1) monitor states to ensure that each one's policies and procedures meet requirements to improve outcomes among infants born and identified as being affected by substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and (2) issue guidance to states regarding the requirements and best practices for the development and implementation of plans of safe care.</summary>
