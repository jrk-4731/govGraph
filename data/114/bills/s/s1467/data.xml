  <summary date="2015-05-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Pedestrian Safety Act of 2015

 This bill directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue a final rule that: (1) establishes standards for the hood and bumper areas of motor vehicles, including passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) or less, in order to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities suffered by pedestrians who are struck by such vehicles; and (2) considers the protection of vulnerable pedestrian populations, including children and older adults.

The bill amends federal-aid highway provisions to include: (1) pedestrian hybrid beacons and roadway improvements that provide separation between pedestrians and motor vehicles, including pedestrian sidewalks and crossing islands, among projects for which the federal share payable is 100%; and (2) safety public awareness campaigns within the definition of "highway safety improvement project."</summary>
