This bill amends the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century with respect to the good repair certification requirement for recipients of funding under the pilot program to demonstrate whether innovative project development and delivery methods or innovative financing arrangements can expedite project delivery for certain meritorious new fixed guideway capital projects and core capacity improvement projects.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) may waive the requirement that a recipient desiring to participate in the program certify that its existing public transportation system is in a state of good repair if the recipient seeks to carry out a core capacity improvement project which will allow the recipient to make substantial progress in achieving a state of good repair.</summary>
