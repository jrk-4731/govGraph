The term excludes tax-exempt organizations.\n\nThe bill establishes: (1) civil penalties for the failure to have an EIN or provide required information, and (2) a criminal penalty for the willful failure to obtain an EIN.\n\nThe IRS may disclose to federal law enforcement officials taxpayer identify information, including an EIN and information from an application for an EIN, for use in investigations and prosecutions of specified offenses related to money laundering and supporting or financing terrorism.\n\nPrior to disclosing the information, the IRS must determine that the disclosure would not seriously impair federal tax administration and consider whether the information requested: (1) is being sought exclusively for use in a federal criminal investigation or proceeding pertaining to the specified offense, (2) is or may be relevant to a matter relating to the offense, and (3) cannot be reasonably obtained from any other source."
