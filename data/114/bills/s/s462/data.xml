This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and publish within 180 days a health advisory with recommendations on: (1) the level of microcystins (toxins produced by freshwater cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae) in drinking water that is safe for human consumption; (2) feasible treatment techniques and other means for achieving a safe level; and (3) standardized procedures for testing for microcystins in drinking water.

The EPA must report annually on: (1) the status of the EPA's efforts to determine whether to regulate microcystins in drinking water, (2) the steps taken by the EPA to promote testing of drinking water for microcystins in areas that have been affected by harmful algal blooms, and (3) an analysis of available treatment techniques and other means for addressing microcystins in drinking water. The EPA must submit its first report within 180 days.</summary>
