Establishes in the USPS the position of Chief Morale Officer who shall oversee USPS employees, including managers, and develop national initiatives that address working conditions, staffing, communication, and training.

Establishes the Rural Postal Service Advisory Commission to provide strategic guidance on enhancing and protecting postal services in rural areas and to foster innovative thinking to address challenges facing the USPS in enhancing and protecting such services.

Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to the USPS considering options for delivery vehicles in rural areas,&#160;providing wireless broadband Internet access service in rural post offices, and&#160;maintaining door or curbside delivery in lieu of centralized delivery.</summary>
