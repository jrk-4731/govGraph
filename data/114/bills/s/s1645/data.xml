Highlights: The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 provides appropriations for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and related agencies for FY2016.

The bill provides annual appropriations for most of the Department of the Interior, including:

 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Indian Education. It does not include the Bureau of Reclamation, which is considered in the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.

Related agencies funded in the bill include the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian Health Service (IHS), the Smithsonian Institution, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The bill includes $1.05 billion in emergency funding for Interior and Forest Service fire suppression activities, which is not subject to discretionary spending limits. The bill also requires the statutory discretionary spending limits to be adjusted in FY2016-FY2021 to accommodate additional funding for fire suppression.

Excluding the emergency funding, the bill decreases regular appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies below FY2015 levels.

Compared to FY2015 funding levels, the bill increases funding for Interior, the Forest Service, and the IHS, while decreasing funding for the EPA.

Within the Interior budget, the bill increases funding for the BLM, the USFWS, the NPS, the USGS, and the Bureaus of Indian Affairs and Indian Education.

The bill funds the Smithsonian Institution, the NEA, the NEH, and the Council on Environmental Quality at the FY2015 levels.

Also included in the bill are several provisions that affect the ability of agencies to implement policies in areas such as greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water quality, endangered species, and hydraulic fracturing.
