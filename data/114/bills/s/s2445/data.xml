  <summary date="2016-01-19T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to study and report to Congress on state administrative expense funds, including:

 the use of the funds by state agencies; policies, practices, and training methods being implemented using the funds; factors that interfere with the ability of a state agency to use the funds effectively; and ways the funds are being used to encourage the implementation of effective and consistent school nutrition workforce training and technical assistance. USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion must study and report to Congress on the effectiveness and level of coordination between nutrition education in the child nutrition programs and other federal programs that include nutrition education.</summary>
