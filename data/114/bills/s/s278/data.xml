  <summary date="2015-01-28T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Citizen Empowerment Act

Requires any executive agency employee who is conducting a covered interaction with an individual to allow the individual to make an audio recording of such interaction at the individual's expense and with the individual's equipment. Defines "covered interaction" as an in-person or telephonic official interaction relating to a possible violation of a federal statute or regulation that could result in the imposition of a fine or penalty against, the forfeiture of property by, or the collection of an unpaid tax, fine, or penalty from, the individual or a business owned or operated by the individual.

Permits the employee conducting a covered interaction to record it if the employee: (1) informs the individual prior to or at the initiation of the interaction, and (2) provides the individual with a transcript or copy of the recording upon request and with the individual's reimbursement.

Requires the employee, before or at an initial covered interaction, to provide to the individual a verbal or written notice of such individual's rights under this Act.

Exempts any such interaction that is likely to include the discussion of: (1) classified material; or (2) information that, if released publicly, would endanger public safety or an ongoing criminal investigation.

Subjects any executive agency employee who violates this Act to disciplinary action.</summary>
