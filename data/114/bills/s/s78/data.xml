Subjects to fines and/or imprisonment any person who knowingly performs an abortion but fails to comply with this Act.

Requires each abortion clinic that receives federal funds or assistance to be licensed by the state and be in compliance with the requirements for ambulatory surgery centers under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, except for requirements related to a certificate of public need.
