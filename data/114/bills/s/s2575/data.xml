This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow new tax credits for 50% of: (1) lead hazard reduction activity costs, (2) radon hazard reduction activity costs, and (3) asbestos hazard reduction activity costs. These costs must be incurred with respect to an eligible dwelling and the credit for such costs is generally limited to $5,000 for any eligible dwelling in any taxable year, reduced by costs taken into account in previous taxable years.

The bill defines an "eligible dwelling" generally as a dwelling unit that is: (1) placed in service before 1950; (2) located in the United States; and (3) a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, or similar property, but not a unit used exclusively as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment.</summary>
