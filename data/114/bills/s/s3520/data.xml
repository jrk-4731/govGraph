  <summary date="2016-12-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Trafficking In Persons Report Integrity Act

This bill amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to revise provisions regarding the Department of State's determination of whether countries are meeting the minimum standards for elimination of human trafficking, including provisions regarding: (1) the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, (2) additional requirements for meeting minimum standards, (3) actions against governments failing to meet minimum standards, (4) the tier ranking process for meeting such standards, and (5) congressional oversight of such process.

The President shall instruct the U.S. executive director of each international financial institution to: (1) support the U.S. policy goal of ending slavery and human trafficking and encourage other nations to adopt similar policies, (2) oppose loans or other programs to Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watch List countries and channel funds from such countries to countries in better compliance with such standards, and (3) propose that other institutions develop anti-human trafficking provisions in their project safeguards and procurement policies.

A Tier 3 country is a country the government of which does not fully meet the minimum standards and is not making significant efforts to do so.

A Tier 2 Watch List country is a country the government of which does not fully meet the minimum standards but is making significant compliance efforts and in which: (1) the number of victims of severe forms of trafficking is very significant or is significantly increasing, (2) there is a failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons from the previous year, or (3) the compliance determination was based on the country's commitments to take additional steps over the next year.</summary>
