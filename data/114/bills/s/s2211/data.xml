This bill amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to make amounts available from the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF) for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to pay federal entities for research and development activities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their use of electromagnetic spectrum under government station licenses in order to make frequencies available for: (1) reallocation for nonfederal use, shared federal and nonfederal use, or a combination of such uses; and (2) auctions in accordance with such reallocation.

As a condition to the OMB paying a federal entity for such activities, the federal entity must have a plan: (1) approved by a technical panel within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and (2) submitted by the OMB to the appropriate congressional committees for a period of 60 days.

The bill also provides for&#160;incumbent federal entities to receive payment from the SRF&#160;for relocation and sharing costs&#160;incurred to accommodate sharing spectrum frequencies assigned to such entity with another federal entity the operations of which are being relocated from other frequencies.</summary>
