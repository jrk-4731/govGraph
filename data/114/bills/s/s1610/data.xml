End Racial Profiling Act of 2015

This bill prohibits racial profiling by federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agents or agencies.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) or an individual may bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief. Proof of disparate impact constitutes prima facie (i.e., sufficient) evidence of racial profiling.

This bills sets forth provisions to eliminate racial profiling, including creating administrative complaint procedures, increasing data collection, and making certain federal funds contingent on law enforcement agencies instituting appropriate policies and procedures.

Police Creating Accountability by Making Effective Recording Available Act of 2015 or the Police CAMERA Act

The DOJ Office of Justice Programs may award grants to states, local, governments, and Indian tribes to acquire body-worn cameras. Grant recipients must establish certain policies and protocols related to body-worn cameras.

 Democracy Restoration Act of 2015

The bill prohibits denial of the right to vote in any federal election due to a criminal conviction, unless the individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution at election time. It also makes convicted felons eligible for federal jury service.

Reclassification to Ensure Smarter and Equal Treatment Act of 2015 or the RESET Act

The bill reduces the penalties for simple possession of a controlled substance by a person with one or more prior drug convictions. It establishes penalties for simple possession of a date rape drug, including flunitrasepam, by person with one or more prior drug conviction.

 It eliminates the sentencing disparity between trafficking in powder cocaine and trafficking in crack cocaine.</summary>
