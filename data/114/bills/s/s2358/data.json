    "text": "Clean Water Compliance and Affordability Act\n\n This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to carry out a pilot program to facilitate the efforts of eligible municipalities to develop and implement integrated plans to meet their wastewater and stormwater obligations under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) in a cost-effective and flexible manner and consistent with the Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Approach Framework issued by the EPA in May 2012. The pilot program must facilitate the efforts of at least 15 municipalities.\n\nA municipality is eligible to participate in the pilot program if it is: (1) a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit holder or designee; or (2) a party to an administrative order, administrative consent agreement, or judicial consent decree to comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act.\n\nThe EPA must give priority to municipalities that: (1) are affected by affordability constraints in planning and implementing control measures addressing wet weather discharges from wastewater and stormwater facilities; and (2) have a history of knowledgeable, detailed, and comprehensive efforts to develop integrated and adaptive clean water management practices. The EPA may give priority to municipalities seeking to develop and implement an integrated plan that includes approaches that adapt to changed or future uncertain circumstances.\n\nWith the mutual agreement of participating municipalities, the EPA may: (1) extend the allowable NPDES permit term by up to 25 years, (2) modify the implementation terms of a consent decree, and (3) provide additional regulatory flexibility in approving and implementing an integrated plan that includes adaptive approaches."
