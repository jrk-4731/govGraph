Requires a federal agency to postpone the effective date of a high-impact rule pending judicial review. Permits such a rule to take effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register if no person seeks judicial review of such rule during such period.

Defines a "high-impact rule" as any rule that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determines may impose an annual cost on the economy of at least $1 billion.</summary>
