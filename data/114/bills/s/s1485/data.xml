  <summary date="2015-06-02T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Water Efficiency Innovation Act of 2015

This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to expand its Industrial Assessment Centers program to: (1) provide assessment services to water and wastewater treatment facilities comparable to those for other energy efficiency improvements, and (2) equip the centers with the training and tools necessary to provide technical assistance on energy savings to those facilities.

A center is located at an institution of higher education that: (1) receives funding from DOE; (2) provides an in-depth assessment of small- and medium-sized manufacturer plant sites to evaluate the facilities, services, and manufacturing operations of the plant sites; and (3) identifies opportunities for potential savings for those sites from energy efficiency improvements, waste minimization, pollution prevention, and productivity improvement.</summary>
