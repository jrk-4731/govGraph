  <summary date="2015-06-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2015

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee to advise HHS on how to: (1) ensure coordination with other federal agencies, private organizations, and constituency groups regarding efforts to address Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases; (2) ensure that a broad spectrum of scientific viewpoints is considered in public health policy decisions and that information disseminated to the public and physicians is based on the best available science; and (3) advise federal agencies on priorities related to tick-borne diseases.

HHS must coordinate federal activities related to tick-borne diseases and conduct or support activities related to tick-borne diseases, including:

 developing diagnostic tools and tests, improving the efficient utilization of diagnostic tests, surveillance and reporting, providing and promoting access to a clearinghouse of information, increasing public education, creating a physician education program on the latest research and treatment options for Lyme disease, research on tick repellents and strategies for the control of ticks, exploring the potential for vaccines, establishing epidemiological research objectives, and determining the effectiveness of different treatments. HHS must report on scientific conferences that cost the federal government more than $100,000 and address tick-borne diseases.</summary>
