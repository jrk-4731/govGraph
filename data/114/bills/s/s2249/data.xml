This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime to operate an unmanned aircraft (i.e., drone) that interferes with or disrupts the operation of an aircraft carrying one or more occupants in U.S. airspace.

The prohibition includes the operation of an unmanned aircraft in the arrival or departure flight path of an airport without permission.

A violator is subject to a fine, a prison term, or both.</summary>
