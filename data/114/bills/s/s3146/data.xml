This bill amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 to require a servicer of a federally related or federally backed mortgage loan to&#160;provide, with respect to foreclosure proceedings,&#160;specified notice to the borrower and applicable taxing district.

Unless specified requirements are met, a servicer of a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration and backed by either the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)&#160;or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) may not abandon an initiated foreclosure.

The Consumer Financial Protection&#160;Bureau must establish a database of abandoned foreclosures.

The Government Accountability Office shall conduct a study on abandoned foreclosures.</summary>
