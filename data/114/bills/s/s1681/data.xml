  <summary date="2015-06-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Quell Unnecessary, Intentional, and Encroaching Telephone Calls Act of 2014 or the QUIET Act 

This bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime to knowingly initiate a commercial robocall, without the prior written consent of the recipient, from within the United States or to a recipient within the United States. The prohibition does not apply to emergency or health-related calls or calls from charitable organizations.

The bill defines "commercial robocall" as a telephone call made using an automatic dialing system or artificial or prerecorded voice to solicit or encourage the purchase of property, goods, or services.

Violators are subject to fines up to $20,000 per violation and/or up to 10 years in prison.</summary>
