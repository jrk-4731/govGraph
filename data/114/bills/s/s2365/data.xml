This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to reduce the fiscal year cap on H-1B nonimmigrant visas (specialty occupations) from 65,000 to 50,000.

If for a fiscal year more than 50,000 H-1B petitions are filed, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall allocate available visas to petitions for those workers who will earn the highest wages.

IF H-1B visa petitions seek more than 20,000 aliens who have earned a master's or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education, DHS shall also allocate the available visas for those petitions seeking such workers who will earn the highest wages.</summary>
