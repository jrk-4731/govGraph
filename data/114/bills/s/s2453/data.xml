This bill requires the Office of Management and Budget to coordinate with relevant federal agencies to: (1) use available administrative authority to eliminate, consolidate, or streamline federal programs and agencies with duplicate and overlapping missions identified in specified reports of the Government Accountability Office issued between 2011 and 2015; (2) determine the total cost savings from the use of such authority; and (3) rescind from appropriate accounts the greater of $10 billion or the total amount of estimated cost savings and apply the savings towards deficit reduction.

The bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Congressional Budget Office to submit an analysis of whether any&#160;legislation reported from a congressional committee that creates a new federal program, office, or initiative would duplicate or overlap with any existing program, office, or initiative with a similar mission, purpose, or goal.</summary>
