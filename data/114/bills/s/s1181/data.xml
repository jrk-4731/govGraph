This bill amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to reauthorize the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program through FY2020.

An "advanced technology vehicle" under the program shall include:

 a U.S.-manufactured, on-highway commercial truck with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or more that meets at least 125% of the average base year combined fuel economy for vehicles with substantially similar attributes, and a U.S.-flagged vessel. The current Department of Transportation (DOT) facility funding awards to automobile manufacturers, among others, shall extend to U.S. commercial truck manufacturers and vessel manufacturers.

DOT, through its Loan Programs Office, shall:

 accelerate efforts to engage sufficient engineering expertise to verify that direct loan borrowers under the program are delivering projects in accordance with applicable loan agreements, and develop sufficient and quantifiable performance measures to achieve the intent of the direct loan program. All proceeds from the repayment of direct loans shall be used by the Treasury to pay down the national debt.

The direct loan program shall be repealed on January 1, 2020.</summary>
