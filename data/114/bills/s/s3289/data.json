The Government Accountability Office shall submit to Congress an audit of the report.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall establish agreements with the Government of Cuba to allow:\n\n the Federal Air Marshal Service to conduct missions on regularly scheduled passenger air flights between the United States and Cuba, and TSA inspectors to access all areas of last point of departure airports in Cuba to assess security. No agreement dated on or after January 1, 2016, to expand air flights between the United States and Cuba may be permitted until: (1)\u00a0the required report and audit have been submitted, (2)\u00a0the required agreements have been established, and (3) specified hiring and training requirements have been met.\n\nDHS, rather than the Department of Transportation, shall: (1)\u00a0assess the effectiveness of security standards at foreign airports, and (2) take other specified actions if an airport fails to maintain effective security measures."
