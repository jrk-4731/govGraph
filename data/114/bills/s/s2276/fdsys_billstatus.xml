          <text><![CDATA[<p>(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on June 8, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)</p> <p><b>Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 or the PIPES Act of 2016 </b></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill reauthorizes through FY2019 the gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and related programs of the Department of Transportation (DOT), including user fees for underground natural gas storage facility safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) operational expenses, one-call notification programs, community pipeline safety information grants, and the pipeline integrity program.</p> <p>(Sec. 3) DOT shall make periodic updates available to the public on DOT's website about the status of a final rule for each outstanding regulation.</p> <p>The term &quot;outstanding regulation&quot; is defined as a required pipeline safety regulation or a gas or hazardous liquid pipeline regulation that has not been published in the Federal Register. </p><p>(Sec. 4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall report on the gas integrity management and hazardous liquid integrity management programs. <p>(Sec. 6) Two of the individuals selected for each Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and each Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee must be state officials (currently, state commissioners). DOT must consult with national organizations representing commissioners (as under current law) or utility regulators prior to making such a selection.</p> <p> (Sec. 7) After completion of any pipeline safety inspection, the PHMSA, or the state authority with a pipeline safety program certification, shall:</p> <ul> <li>conduct within 30 days a post-inspection briefing with the pipeline owner or operator outlining concerns, and </li> <li>provide within 90 days, to the extent practicable, written preliminary findings.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 8) DOT shall study improving existing damage prevention programs through technological improvements in location, mapping, and communications practices to prevent excavation damage to a pipe or its coating, including considerations of technical, operational, and economic feasibility and existing damage prevention programs.</p> <p>(Sec. 9) The DOT Inspector General shall review PHMSA's staff resource management, including geographic allocation plans, hiring and time-to-hire challenges, and expected retirement rates and strategies.</p> <p>The PHMSA, after making an identification of any previous periods of macroeconomic and pipeline industry conditions under which it has encountered difficulty in filling vacancies, may apply to the Office of Personnel Management for the authority to appoint qualified candidates to positions relating to pipeline safety.</p> <p>(Sec. 10) DOT shall convene a working group to consider the development of a voluntary information sharing system to encourage collaborative efforts to improve inspection information feedback and information sharing regarding gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipeline integrity risk analysis.</p> <p>(Sec. 11) DOT:</p> <ul> <li>shall report on the feasibility of a national integrated pipeline safety regulatory inspection database to improve communication and collaboration between the PHMSA and state pipeline regulators; </li> <li>may establish, if appropriate, such database; and</li> <li>shall issue minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities (such as depleted hydrocarbon, aquifer, or solution mined salt cavern reservoirs). </li> </ul> <p>The bill imposes a fee on the operator of an underground natural gas storage facility, and establishes the Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility Safety Account in the Pipeline Safety Fund to receive such fees. </p> <p>(Sec. 13) DOT shall allow for a state authority with a pipeline safety program certification, at its request, to participate in the inspection of an interstate pipeline facility.</p> <p>(Sec. 14) Each hazardous liquid pipeline facility owner or operator shall provide safety data sheets on any spilled oil to the designated federal On-Scene Coordinator and state and local emergency responders within six hours of notice of a spill to the National Response Center.</p> <p>(Sec. 15) DOT shall issue an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment on the petition for rulemaking dated October 28, 2015, titled &quot;Corrections to Title 49 CFR 172.336 Hazardous Materials Identification numbers;
