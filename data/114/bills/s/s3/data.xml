This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require at least 5% of the new markets tax credit limitation to be allocated to community development entities in connection with certain investments, financial counseling, and other services in distressed coal communities.

A "distressed coal community" is any low-income community located in a county that: (1) was one of the 30 counties with the biggest employment decrease among coal operators over a specified time period; or (2) is contiguous to a county that has the required decrease in employment, is located in the same state, and contains at least one low-income community.</summary>
