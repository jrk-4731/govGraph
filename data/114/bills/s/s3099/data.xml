Access for Sportfishing Act of 2016

(Sec.2)This bill requires the National Park Service to meet several requirements before implementing any fishing restrictions in Biscayne National Park located in Homestead, Florida. The requirements include basing any restriction on sound fisheries management, coordinating with the state of Florida, prioritizing scientific information relied upon by the state of Florida, and ensuring any restriction is the least restrictive measure necessary.

(Sec.3)Additionally, the bill amends the Shark Conservation Act of 2010 to make shark feeding illegal in all U.S. waters.

The bill alsoamends the Billfish Conservation Act to maintain a prohibition on the sale of marlin, sailfish, and spearfish while ensuring that the exemption for traditional fisheries does not create new markets for these species.

Nothing in this bill shall affect the authority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish conservation and management regulationsunder the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.</summary>
