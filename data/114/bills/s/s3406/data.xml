 This bill amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to require the state plans for the use of child care and development block grant funds to include, as part of its regulatory process for issuance and renewal of licenses to providers of child care services, a recommendation to each such provider that it carry liability insurance covering the operation of its child care business.

State plans shall certify that there is in effect within the state a requirement that each such provider for which assistance is made available: (1) post publicly and conspicuously in the service area of its premises a notice specifying whether it carries liability insurance covering the operation of its child care business; and (2) give written notice to parents about whether it carries such insurance, obtain the signature of at least one parent per child acknowledging receipt of the notice, and maintain records of the notice while a child receives services.</summary>
