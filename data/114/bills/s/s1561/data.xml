 Amends the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 to define "captive insurance company" as an insurance company wholly owned directly or indirectly: (1) by a single parent company and whose primary purpose is to insure the risks of that single parent company or its affiliates; (2) by a group of companies and whose primary purpose is to insure the risks of that group or its affiliates; and (3) by an industry, trade, or service group or association, and whose primary purpose is to insure the risks of any member in that group or association, including any member affiliate.

Excludes a captive insurance company from the meaning of a "nonadmitted insurer" (that is not licensed to engage in the business of insurance in a state), and from any requirements (including state tax requirements) applying to a nonadmitted insurer.</summary>
