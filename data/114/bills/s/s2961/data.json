Health care providers must begin reporting on their performance relating to such measures on April 1, 2018.\n\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration must approve existing and develop new curricula on advance care planning and end-of-life care for continuing education that states may adopt for qualified health care providers.\n\nHHS must establish a demonstration program for supporting the provision of advance care planning through videoconferencing for patients who live far from their health care provider."
