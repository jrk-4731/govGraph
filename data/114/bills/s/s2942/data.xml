(Sec. 1) This bill amends the International Organizations Immunities Act to authorize the President to extend the provisions of such Act to the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf to the same extent, and subject to the same conditions, as may be extended to a public international organization in which the United States participates pursuant to any treaty or under the authority of any Act of Congress.

(The International Organization Immunities Act entitles covered international organizations and their employees to certain exemptions, immunities, and privileges similar to the benefits granted to foreign governments.)</summary>
