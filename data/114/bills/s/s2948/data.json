Those institutions must also, to the extent practicable, ensure that students have access to such examinations.\n\nThe bill amends the Public Health Service Act by requiring HHS to establish: (1) a demonstration grant program for equipping new providers with the clinical training necessary to establish and maintain competency in sexual assault forensic examiner and sexual assault nurse examiner services; and (2) a center that provides technical assistance to states and health care providers for increasing the quality of, and access to, sexual assault examinations.\n\nHHS must convene state and hospital regional learning collectives to assist health care providers and states in sharing best practices, discussing practices, and improving the quality of, and access to, sexual assault examinations."
