This bill adjusts the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in California as depicted on a specified map to include the area known as the Rim of the Valley Unit.

The unit, and any lands or interests acquired by the United States and located within its boundaries, shall be administered as part of the recreation area.

The Department of the Interior may acquire only through exchange, donation, or purchase from a willing seller any nonfederal land within the boundaries of the unit.

Nothing in this bill authorizes the use of eminent domain to acquire lands or interests within the boundaries of the unit.

No part of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory shall be considered for inclusion in the unit until specified cleanups of soil at the laboratory have been completed.</summary>
