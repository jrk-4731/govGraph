The bill: (1) directs DOJ to administer a troops-to-cops program to encourage the use of grants to hire and train former members of the Armed Forces as career law enforcement officers, (2) authorizes DOJ to award grants to pay for additional community prosecuting programs, and (3) authorizes DOJ to award grants to develop and use new crime-prevention technologies."
