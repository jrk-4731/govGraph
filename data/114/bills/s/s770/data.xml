Authorizes Escambia County, Florida, to convey its interest in any part of the former Santa Rosa Island National Monument land that was conveyed to it by the federal government in 1947 to any person or entity, without restriction.

Prohibits any person or entity holding a leasehold interest in such land from being required to involuntarily accept a fee interest to such land in place of the leasehold interest.

 Allows Escambia County to convey any interest in any part of such land that is within the jurisdictional boundaries of Santa Rosa County, Florida, to such county.

Permits Santa Rosa County or any other person to whom such county reconveys such land to reconvey any part of it. Requires any proceeds from the conveyance of such land by either county to be considered windfall profits that shall revert to the United States.

 Instructs Escambia County and Santa Rosa County to preserve those areas of the land conveyed under this Act that, as of the enactment of this Act, are dedicated for conservation, preservation, public recreation access, and public parking.</summary>
