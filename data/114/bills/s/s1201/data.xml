  <summary date="2015-05-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Clean Distributed Energy Grid Integration Act

This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to: (1) study the status of integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids, (2) identify issues requiring additional research or regulatory development, and (3) make grants for research proposals that address technical barriers identified in the study.

"Clean distributed energy" means energy technologies that are located on the customer site operating on the customer side of the electric meter and are interconnected with the electric grid. DOE shall convene a stakeholder working group to:

 address regulatory barriers to deployment of intelligent grid integration of clean distributed energy technologies; and provide guidance on how to address the technical, regulatory, and economic factors that limit widespread integration of grid-level clean distributed energy use in order to advance the integration of such energy into electric grids. DOE may make grants to implement integration demonstration projects, based on study findings, to state and local agencies, public institutions, private companies, electric utilities, and equipment manufacturers.</summary>
