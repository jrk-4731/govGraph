  <summary date="2015-01-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Expresses the sense of Congress that, now that evidence is available that nullifies the most controversial aspects of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (the Goldstone Report), the United Nations (U.N.) should formally retract the Report.

Directs the Secretary of State to withhold U.S. contributions to the regularly assessed U.N. biennial budget until the U.N. formally retracts the Report.

Defines "formally retracts" as a U.N.-adopted resolution stating that insufficient information relating to the Report's subject matter was available before its release and that the Report is annulled.</summary>
