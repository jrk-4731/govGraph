 (Sec. 3) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend through FY2021 the controlled substance monitoring program, including to:

 allow grants to be used to maintain existing state controlled substance monitoring programs; require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to redistribute any funds that are returned among the remaining grantees; require states to report on the interoperability of their programs with federal programs and health information technology systems and whether their programs provide automatic, up-to-date, or daily information about a patient upon request; require states to provide HHS with aggregate data and other information to enable HHS to evaluate the success of state programs; and expand the program to include any commonwealth or territory of the United States. The Drug Enforcement Administration, HHS, a state Medicaid program, a state health department, or a state substance abuse agency receiving nonidentifiable information from a controlled substance monitoring database for research purposes may make that information available to other entities for research purposes.

HHS is no longer required to give preference for grants related to drug abuse to states with controlled substance monitoring programs.

 A state receiving a grant for a controlled substance monitoring program must: (1) facilitate prescriber and dispenser use of the controlled substance monitoring system, and (2) educate prescribers and dispensers on the benefits of the system.</summary>
