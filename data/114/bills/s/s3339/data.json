Currently, individual\u00a0taxpayers under age 65\u00a0may only deduct those medical expenses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income. This bill reduces that percentage to 7.5% for all taxpayers for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015. \u00a0\n\nThe threshold percentage remains at 10% for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax (AMT)."
