          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Medicare Patient Empowerment Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to allow any Medicare beneficiary to enter into a contract with an eligible professional, regardless of whether the professional is a participating or non-participating physician or practitioner, for any item or service covered by Medicare. Such beneficiaries may submit a claim for Medicare payment in the amount that would otherwise apply, except that, where the professional is considered to be non-participating, payment shall be paid as if the professional were participating.</p> <p>An "eligible professional" is&nbsp; a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, certified nurse-midwife, clinical social worker, clinical psychologist, </s> physical or occupational therapist, qualified speech-language pathologist, or qualified audiologist.</p> <p>A Medicare beneficiary must agree in writing in such a contract to: (1) pay the eligible professional for a Medicare-covered item or service; and (2) submit, in lieu of the eligible professional, a claim for Medicare payment. However, a beneficiary maynegotiate, as a term of the contract, for the eligible professional to file such claims on the beneficiary's behalf.</p> <p>The bill preempts state laws from limiting the amount of charges for physician and practitioner services for which Medicare payment is made.</p>]]></text>
