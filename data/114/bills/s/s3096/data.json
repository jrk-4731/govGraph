An \"advance care collaborative\" is an affiliated group of providers, physicians, or practitioners.\n\nUnder the program, a participating advance care collaborative\u00a0may use a pre-implementation grant to: (1) conduct a needs assessment; (2) modify, upgrade, or purchase health information technology; (3) conduct\u00a0education and training; (4) hire staff to conduct care management and\u00a0coordination activities; and (5) conduct other appropriate activities.\u00a0\n\nWith respect to coverage and payment for services provided to a target Medicare beneficiary by a participating collaborative, CMS shall waive\u00a0specified requirements related to: (1) coverage of curative care with respect to individuals receiving hospice care, (2) alternative certification for home care and hospice care, (3) coverage of skilled nursing services without an inpatient stay, and (4) coverage of home health care without homebound status.\n\nUnder the program, a participating collaborative may receive payment for furnishing target Medicare beneficiaries with: (1) inpatient care as an alternative to routine hospice care, and (2) home-based respite care as an alternative to inpatient respite care.\n\nA participating collaborative shall be eligible for shared savings payments.\n\nCMS\u00a0shall identify and develop a recommended set of advance care quality measures that may be tested in the pilot program."
