This bill makes the designation of a national monument by the President subject to the following consultation and approval requirements.

No national monuments may be designated by the President unless:

 each county, borough, parish, or equivalent unit of local government within and adjacent to the boundaries of which the proposed monument is to be located has been consulted respecting the designation and has approved it; and the governor and the legislature of each state within the boundaries of which such monument is to be located has approved it. Any national monument that is designated subject to such requirements shall be open to hunting, fishing, other forms of recreation, grazing, and historic or traditional uses, unless the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), or the Department of the Army closes all or a portion of the monument to one or more of such uses in accordance with the purposes of federal law relating to monuments, ruins, sites, and objects of antiquity.

Interior shall not impose any restrictions on hunting, fishing, grazing, wildlife management, or other historic or traditional uses at a national monument that is designated subject to this bill until the end of an appropriate review period which provides for, respecting the proposed restriction, concurrence by the applicable state wildlife management agencies, public input, and approval by Congress.</summary>
