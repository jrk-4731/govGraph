USDA may take measures within the wilderness area necessary for the control of fire, insects, and disease.\n\nNothing in this bill creates a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the wilderness area.\n\nUSDA shall ensure that Indian tribes have access to the wilderness area for:\n\n traditional and cultural purposes, and the exercise of any right reserved by treaty."
