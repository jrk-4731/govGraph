This bill designates approximately 13,961 acres of National Forest System land in Idaho, to be known as the Scotchman Peaks Wilderness, as wilderness and a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

The wilderness area is withdrawn from specified public land, mining, mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws.

The Department of Agriculture (USDA) may carry out management activities to maintain or restore fish and wildlife populations and habitats within the wilderness area if they would:

 promote healthy, viable, and more naturally distributed populations that would enhance wilderness values; and accomplish the purpose of the management activity with the minimum impact necessary. USDA may take measures within the wilderness area necessary for the control of fire, insects, and disease.

Nothing in this bill creates a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the wilderness area.

USDA shall ensure that Indian tribes have access to the wilderness area for:

 traditional and cultural purposes, and the exercise of any right reserved by treaty.</summary>
