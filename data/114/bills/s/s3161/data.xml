This bill amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to include the Secretary of Agriculture on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and to require CFIUS to consider the national security-related effects on agricultural assets in reviewing transactions.

(CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized under current law to review transactions that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person in order to determine the effects of the transactions on national security.)</summary>
