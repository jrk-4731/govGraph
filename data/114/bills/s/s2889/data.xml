This bill amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2010 to direct the National Science Foundation (NSF) to:

 carry out an Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program to award grants for entrepreneurship and commercialization education to science and engineering researchers and students and institutions of higher education to increase the economic impact of federally funded research; and develop and provide access through specified Nodes, Sites, and Teams to I-Corps program curriculum by supporting entrepreneurship and commercialization education and training for faculty, students, postdoctoral fellows, and other science and engineering researchers. The purpose of grants shall be to increase the capacity of science and engineering researchers and students to engage successfully in entrepreneurial activities and to help transition the results of federally funded research into the marketplace.

The Treasury may:

 locate and recover U.S. government assets on behalf of any executive, judicial, or legislative agency; and retain a portion of recovered amounts to cover administrative and operational costs associated with locating and recovering those assets.</summary>
