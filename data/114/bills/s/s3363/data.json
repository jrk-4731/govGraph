The funds are only available if the President subsequently designates the amounts as emergency spending and transmits the designations to Congress.\n\nThe bill amends the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 to reauthorize sanctions against Iran until December 31, 2031. (Under current law, the sanctions expire on December 31, 2016.)"
