  <summary date="2015-08-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to revise requirements for notifying a voting registrar of a change of address before the date of an election.

If a registrant has failed to notify the registrar of a change of address within a state before an election day, the registrant shall nevertheless, upon an oral or written affirmation before an election official, be permitted to vote at either the polling place of the registrant's current address or a central location within the same registrar's jurisdiction.</summary>
