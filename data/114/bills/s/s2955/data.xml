Highlights: 

This bill provides FY2017 appropriations for the legislative branch, including the Senate and the agencies that support Congress.

It also provides appropriations for:

 the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the Library of Congress (LOC), the Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Pursuant to a longstanding practice under which each chamber of Congress determines its own requirements, the Senate bill does not include funds for the House of Representatives.

The bill increases overall legislative branch funding above the FY2016 level and includes an increase for the Senate.

For other legislative branch agencies and programs, the bill:

 increases funding above FY2016 levels for the Capitol Police, the LOC, and the GAO; decreases funding below FY2016 levels for the AOC; and funds the CBO and the GPO at the FY2016 level. The bill also prohibits a cost of living adjustment for Members of Congress during FY2017.
