  <summary date="2015-12-01T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) to direct the Department of the Interior to require that coal lease royalty payments from a new or renewed coal lease on federal land be at least 50% of the value of coal.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to direct the President to promulgate a rule prohibiting the export of coal produced in the U.S. on federal land.

Interior shall not conduct a new lease sale, or enter into a new lease, for coal subject to the MLA until it certifies to Congress that this Act and its amendments have been implemented.</summary>
