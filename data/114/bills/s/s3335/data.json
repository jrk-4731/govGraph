Reports are required for prescription drugs and drugs commonly administered in hospitals, except vaccines, drugs for rare conditions, and drugs with annual sales for Medicare and Medicaid enrollees of less than $1.\n\nManufacturers that do not submit a required report are subject to a civil penalty. The Inspector General of HHS must review drug price information to determine compliance. Collected penalty funds must be used to carry out activities related to this reporting requirement and to improve consumer and provider information about drug value and drug price transparency.\n\nHHS must publish manufacturer reports, a summary of those reports, and supporting analyses."
