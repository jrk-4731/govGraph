    "text": "Gulf States Protection and Restoration Coordination Act\n\nThis bill amends the Coastal Zone Management Act to designate the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) as a regional coordination entity of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The regional coordination would strengthen collaboration efforts among federal, state, local, and private participants in the five Gulf states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) to restore and protect the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.\n\nThe designation authorizes the GOMA to:\n\n unify the efforts of participants to efficiently restore and protect the ecosystem, provide grants to implement specific action plans that meet coordination goals, improve water quality in the ecosystem, publish information about living coastal and marine resources in the ecosystem, develop public outreach programs that foster stewardship of the ecosystem, and serve as the liaison to the Mexican members of the Gulf of Mexico States Accord and Mexican counterparts. Any grants issued by the GOMA for ecosystem research can be used to:\n\n monitor and develop strategies that address water quality needs, investigate the effects of natural and human-induced changes, restore and sustain living coastal and marine resources, restore and conserve key habitats, or eliminate contamination problems. In addition, the GOMA is required to submit to NOAA an annual report that describes the goals, objectives, and benefits of any efforts undertaken to strengthen cooperation among participants in restoring and protecting the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Furthermore, NOAA is required to submit to Congress an assessment, every three years, on the effectiveness of the GOMA's ability to coordinate regional restoration and protection efforts in the ecosystem."
