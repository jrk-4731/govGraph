This bill states that among the principal U.S. trade negotiating objectives for trade agreements with foreign countries regarding commercial partnerships are to:

 discourage actions that directly or indirectly prejudice or discourage commercial activity solely between the United States and Israel; discourage politically motivated actions by foreign countries, non-member United Nations states, and international organizations (including affiliated agencies), that are intended to penalize or limit commercial relations with Israel, persons doing business with Israel or in territories controlled by Israel, or successor entities to such persons; seek the elimination of politically motivated nontariff barriers on goods, services, or other commerce from Israel, as well as any boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against Israel; or discourage compliance with the boycott of Israel by the Arab League.</summary>
