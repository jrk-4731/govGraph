Researchers may apply to have other research covered by this prohibition.\n\nDisclosures of such information are permitted if required by law, necessary for the medical treatment of the research subject, made with the consent of the subject, or made for the purposes of other research that is in compliance with regulations regarding protection of subjects.\n\nHHS may exempt identifiable information collected for biomedical research from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act."
