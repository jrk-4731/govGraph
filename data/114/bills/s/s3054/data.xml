This bill requires the Department of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of significant civil rights sites, including:

 the former home of Medgar Evers in Jackson, Mississippi; the Tallahatchie County Courthouse in Sumner, Mississippi; the site of Bryant's Store in Money, Mississippi; the former office of Dr. Gilbert in Biloxi, Mississippi; and the Old Neshoba County Jail in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Interior must submit its recommendations to Congress after evaluating the suitability and feasibility of designating each site as a unit of the National Park System and considering other alternatives for preservation, protection, and interpretation by federal, state, or local governments or private or nonprofit organizations.</summary>
