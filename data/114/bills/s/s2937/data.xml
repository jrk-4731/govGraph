Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2017

This bill directs the Department of State to: (1) submit to Congress a U.S. strategy and implementing plan for combating sexual exploitation and abuse in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and (2) designate a country as a "peacekeeping abuse country of concern" if indications are that personnel from its U.N. peacekeeping contingent have engaged in acts of sexual exploitation. The State Department may withhold specified assistance from a foreign security unit that has engaged in such acts.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall conduct a study of the formula and methods by which the U.N. assesses member states for financial support to peacekeeping operations.

Not more than 85% of the annual U.S. contributions to the U.N., its agencies, or the Organization of American States may be obligated until the State Department certifies that specified whistle blower protections have been implemented.

U.S. funding may not be made available for the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) until the State Department certifies that UNHRC participation is in the U.S. national interest.

Foreign Service administrative provisions are set forth, including provisions regarding: (1) overseas housing, (2) locally employed staff, (3) a lateral entry pilot program, (4) annuitant reemployment, (5) disciplinary action for unsatisfactory leadership during a security incident, (6) a personal services contractor pilot program, (7) limited appointments, and (8) diversity.

The State Department may establish employee exchange programs with foreign government or international entities that permit employees to be assigned to a State Department position.

The bill modifies the passport and visa fee structures.

The State Department shall: (1) conduct a review of all human rights dialogues, and (2) provide each Tier 2 Watch List country with a copy of the annual Trafficking in Persons Report and information pertinent to such country's designation.

The bill expresses: (1) the sense of Congress with respect to foreign cyber security threats, and (2) the sense of the Senate with respect to the release of internationally adopted children from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The State Department may authorize its uniformed guards to protect buildings and areas within the United States for which it provides protective services.</summary>
