  <summary date="2015-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency, when taking an action regarding air emissions from an energy source or facility that uses forest biomass, to assume that forest biomass emissions do not increase overall carbon accumulations in the atmosphere if: (1) a Department of Agriculture's Forest Inventory and Analysis that is current at the time the action is taken shows that forest carbon stocks in the United States are stable or increasing; or (2) the forest biomass is derived from mill residuals, harvest residuals, or forest management activities.</summary>
