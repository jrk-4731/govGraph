(Sec. 2) Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make publicly available a user-friendly database of information relating to lenders making loans under such Act or the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.

Requires the SBA to: (1) include in the database information on such loans made during FY2009-FY2015, and (2) incorporate information relating to such loans on an ongoing basis.

Prohibits the SBA from requiring lenders to submit additional information or to otherwise increase burdens on lenders in order to comply with this Act.

Expresses the sense of Congress that no additional funds should be made available to carry out this Act.</summary>
