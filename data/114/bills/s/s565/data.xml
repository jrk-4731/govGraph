Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act of 2015

(Sec. 3) Defines "remanufactured vehicle component" as a vehicle component (including an engine, transmission, alternator, starter, turbocharger, steering, or suspension component) that has been returned to same-as-new, or better, condition and performance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates technical specifications (including engineering, quality, and testing standards) to yield fully warranted products.

(Sec. 4) Directs the head of each federal agency to: (1) encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain federal vehicles if using such components reduces the cost of maintaining such vehicles while maintaining quality; and (2) not encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components if using such components does not reduce the cost of maintenance, lowers the quality of vehicle performance,&#160;or delays the return to service of a vehicle.</summary>
