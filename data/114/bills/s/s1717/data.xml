(Sec. 1) This bill extends through October 31, 2028, the exemption of certain vessels from the requirement that U.S. passenger vessels having berth or stateroom accommodations for at least 50 passengers be constructed of fire-retardant materials in order to be granted a certificate of inspection.

The bill continues to apply this exemption only to vessels in operation before January 1, 1968, which operate only within the Boundary Line (the dividing point between inland waters and high seas).

An owner or managing operator of an exempt vessel shall:

 notify crew members (currently, only prospective passengers) that the vessel does not comply with applicable fire safety standards due primarily to the wooden construction of passenger berthing areas; and make annual structural alterations to at least 10% of vessel areas that are not constructed of fire-retardant materials and provide advance notice to the Coast Guard of such alterations. Any noncombustible material requirements prescribed by the Coast Guard (with which an exempt vessel is still required to comply) shall be consistent with the preservation of a vessel's historic integrity in areas carrying or accessible to passengers or generally visible to the public.</summary>
