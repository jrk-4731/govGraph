  <summary date="2015-04-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase from $500 million to $1 billion the asset size of small insured depository institutions eligible for 18-month on-site examination cycles.

A federal banking agency is granted discretion to increase the asset ceiling amount from $100 million to $1 billion (currently from $100 million to $500 million) if the greater asset size would be consistent with the principles of safety and soundness.</summary>
