This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to publish an interim final rule to revise certain Medicaid transportation regulations to allow states to reimburse drivers for costs attributable to providing no-load volunteer travel services to Medicaid-eligible individuals who require transportation to receive non-emergency medical treatment.

The Department of Transportation may prioritize and carry out projects within the Rural Transportation Assistance Program to increase access to health care services in rural areas.

The bill establishes the Interagency Task Force on Rural Health Information Technology to coordinate delivery of financial and technical assistance to rural providers and provide leadership and recommendations on best practices to increase internet access in rural areas.

The bill also requires the Federal Communications Commission to simplify the process for submitting a request for services under the&#160;Healthcare Connect Fund, which expands access to broadband services for health care providers in rural areas.</summary>
