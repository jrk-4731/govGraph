This bill sets forth a regulatory process for preventing the introduction and establishment in the United States of certain injurious wildlife that is likely to cause harm to: (1) humans; (2) interests in agriculture, horticulture, or forestry; or (3) wildlife or wildlife resources.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) may: (1) designate certain wildlife as injurious, and (2) make immediate and temporary emergency designations if the injurious wildlife poses an imminent threat. Interested persons may petition the USFWS to designate wildlife as injurious.

The bill: (1) gives the Department of the Interior the primary authority to prevent the importation and sale of wildlife pathogens and harmful parasites, and (2) establishes requirements that address those pathogens and parasites.

The bill prohibits: (1) importing into the United States, or transporting between states, injurious wildlife or wildlife not in trade; and (2) possessing or releasing into the wild such wildlife.

USFWS may issue permits that authorize the importation or transport of injurious wildlife for scientific, zoological, medical research, or educational purposes.

USFWS must establish user fees for live wildlife imports.

The bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations.

Interior must establish a grant program for supporting states and Indian tribes in: (1) inspecting and monitoring interstate transport of wildlife, and (2) assessing risks associated with the intentional importation of wildlife.

 The bill establishes the Injurious Wildlife Prevention Fund to carry out this bill. Revenues generated by user fees and penalties must be deposited into the fund.</summary>
