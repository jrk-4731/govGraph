This bill prohibits a federal agency from promulgating a rule that conflicts with or fails to carry out any concurrent resolution enacted by Congress that clarifies the meaning of a provision of law, including a clarification of whether a law delegates certain authority to an agency. If an agency has a rule in effect that conflicts with or fails to carry out the meaning of the resolution, the agency must promulgate new rules that carry out such meaning.</summary>
