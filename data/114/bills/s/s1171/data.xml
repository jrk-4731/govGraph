This bill prohibits conducting geological or geophysical activities in support of oil or gas exploration and development in any area located within a specified exclusive economic zone located off the coastline of Florida.

This moratorium shall only be terminated if the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (of the Department of Commerce) determines that the reasonably foreseeable impacts of such activities are minimal to individuals or populations of marine mammals, sea turtles, or fish.

These geological or geophysical activities are described in the final programmatic environmental impact statement of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (of the Department of the Interior) entitled "Atlantic OCS Proposed Geological and Geophysical Activities, Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas," completed February 2014.</summary>
