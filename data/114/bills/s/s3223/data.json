(Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.)\n\nFunding is allocated to a state based on the severity of the opioid epidemic in the state and the strength of the state's response strategy.\n\nThe bill provides funds for these cooperative agreements for FY2017 and FY2018."
