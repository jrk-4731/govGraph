Requires the Secretary of the Treasury, during a funding gap impacting the Armed Forces, to make available to the Secretary of Defense (the Secretary), and the Secretary of Homeland Security in the case of the Coast Guard, out of any amounts in the general fund of the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as necessary to continue to provide pay and allowances to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including reserve components, who perform active service during the funding gap. Allows for the provision of such pay and allowances, at the discretion of the Secretary, to: (1) Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel providing support to such members, and (2) DOD contractor personnel providing direct support to such members.
