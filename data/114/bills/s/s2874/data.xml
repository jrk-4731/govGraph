This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to specify that a state&#160;Medicaid program&#160;may not terminate a juvenile's medical assistance enrollment because the juvenile is incarcerated.&#160;A state may suspend enrollment while the juvenile is an inmate, but must restore enrollment upon release without requiring a new application or any other action unless the individual no longer meets the eligibility requirements for medical assistance.

A state&#160;must process an application submitted by, or on behalf of, an incarcerated juvenile, notwithstanding that the juvenile is an inmate.

A "juvenile" is an individual who: (1) is under 21 years of age; or (2) has aged out of the state's&#160;foster care system, was enrolled in&#160;the state plan while in foster care, and is under 26 years of age.</summary>
