In developing the process, the EPA must establish within the Office of Environmental Justice a process for the communities to request expedited testing of the quality of drinking water.\n\nThe EPA must develop an electronic database of drinking water quality and health screening tests.\n\nThe EPA may make grants for educating residents in minority, tribal, or low-income communities about: (1) drinking water contaminants that may have adverse effects on human health, and (2) the assistance that the EPA may provide in addressing the contaminants.\n\nThe EPA may create a partnership for researching contaminants in drinking water.\n\nThe bill revises reporting requirements, inspection requirements, and enforcement provisions concerning violations of national primary drinking water standards.\n\nThe EPA must issue a rule establishing requirements for electronic submission of compliance data by public water systems and states with primary enforcement responsibilities.\n\nThe bill establishes additional requirements for those states with respect to notifications of violations of drinking water regulations that have the potential to have serious adverse effects on human health."
