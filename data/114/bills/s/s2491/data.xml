This bill amends the Head Start Act to establish five-year, nonrenewable grants for eligible entities to carry out Head Start programs in communities affected by the pollution of water&#160;by lead or a toxic pollutant in an event declared by the President to be an emergency.

In awarding these grants, the Department of Education shall give priority to eligible entities in partnerships with child care providers&#160;that are providing child care services at the time of the enactment of this bill.</summary>
