(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to publish a strategic plan that addresses research, training, the biomedical workforce, and collaboration with other agencies. Common Fund strategic planning is included in this strategic plan.

(Sec. 3) In assessing research priorities, the NIH must publish data on certain clinical research study populations. The NIH must foster collaboration among clinical research projects that use human subjects and that collect similar data to increase the number and diversity of subjects.

(Sec. 4) The strategic plans of the national research institutes must ensure that future activities take into account women and minorities and are focused on reducing health disparities. Advisory council reports must include certain demographic data for clinical research subjects. The results of NIH-funded clinical trials that include women and minorities must be submitted to NIH's clinical trial data bank.

(Sec. 5) The NIH must encourage efforts to improve research related to the health of sexual and gender minority populations, including by facilitating participation by such populations and addressing methodological challenges. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in collaboration with the NIH, must continue to support development of measures related to reporting health information about sexual and gender minority populations and must publish such measures.

(Sec. 6) The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities may foster partnerships among the national research institutes and encourage the funding of collaborative research projects to achieve NIH goals related to minority health and health disparities.

(Sec. 7) The NIH must convene a working group to make recommendations to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-funded research.

(Sec. 8) HHS must establish the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women to report on issues including development of safe and effective therapies for such women.

(Sec. 9) The NIH must develop policies for NIH-funded basic research projects to assess how differences between male and female cells, tissues, or animals may be examined and analyzed.</summary>
