  <summary date="2015-03-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Workplace Advancement Act

Prohibits discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex. (Allows payment of different wages under seniority systems, merit systems, systems that measure earnings by quantity or quality of production, or differentials based on any other factors other than sex.)

 Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discharging or retaliating against any employee because such employee has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed comparative compensation information for the purpose of determining whether the employer is compensating an employee in a manner that provides equal pay for equal work.

Makes such prohibition inapplicable to instances in which an employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a part of such employee's job functions discloses the wages of such other employees other than in response to a charge or complaint or in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under provisions prohibiting sex discrimination, including an investigation conducted by the employer.</summary>
