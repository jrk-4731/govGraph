This bill amends the federal criminal code to establish enhanced penalties for tax return identity theft crimes and other related fraud, including those committed against members of certain vulnerable and targeted groups.

Additionally, the bill modifies the state of mind requirement in identity theft prosecutions to eliminate the need to prove that a defendant knew that the means of identification belonged to another person.</summary>
