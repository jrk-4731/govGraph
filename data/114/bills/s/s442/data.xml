Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award competitive matching grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) through an Innovation Inspiration grant program to: (1) promote science, technology, engineering (including robotics), and mathematics (STEM) in secondary schools and after school programs; (2) support the participation of secondary school students in nontraditional STEM teaching methods; and (3) broaden secondary school students' access to STEM careers.

Directs the Secretary to give priority to grant applications that target: (1) a rural or urban school, (2) a low-performing school or LEA, or (3) an LEA or school that serves students who are eligible for free or reduced price lunches under the school lunch program.

Authorizes the Secretary to waive all or part of the matching requirement for financially-strapped LEAs.

Directs the Secretary to evaluate the efficacy of the grant program.</summary>
