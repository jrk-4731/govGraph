This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise federal explosives laws.

It includes, within the meaning of "explosives," black powder substitutes and smokeless powder.

Additionally, the bill revises certain exceptions to federal explosives laws to specify that: (1) activities related to small arms ammunition do not include activities involving smokeless powder in excess of 50 pounds; and (2) the 50-pound maximum quantity, with respect to a lawful purchase of commercially manufactured black powder, includes aggregate quantities of black powder and black powder substitutes.

Finally, it amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose penalties on an individual who attempts to make an illegal firearm.</summary>
