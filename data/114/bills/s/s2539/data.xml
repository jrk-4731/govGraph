  <summary date="2016-02-10T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Child Care Access to Resources for Early-learning Act or the Child CARE Act 

This bill amends title IV part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of the Social Security Act to make appropriations for FY2017-FY2021 to the Department of Health and Human Services for allotments to states to:

 expand access to high-quality child care for infants and toddlers from low-income families who do not receive child care funded through the Child Care and Development (CCD) Fund, and increase the quality of such care for infants and toddlers who do receive child care funded through the CCD Fund. The state shall reserve at least 80% of funds for direct services provided through grants, contracts, or certificates, to expand access to high-quality child care for infants and toddlers and to increase parental options for and access to such care.

The state shall use the cost of a mandatory triennial high-quality child care study to ensure that for all infant and toddler child care slots: (1) the child care is of sufficient quality, (2) the care providers are supported along a career pathway to achieve higher levels of training and education, and (3) the provider rates are sufficient.

The state shall also ensure that all infant and toddler child care providers participating in CCD Fund-supported activities meet certain quality standards by the end of FY2026.

The state shall: (1) identify underserved geographic areas and special populations; and (2) develop and implement a plan to increase the availability of high-quality child care in such areas and populations, especially those which are hard-to-serve.

The state shall reserve certain funds to carry out specified activities to increase the quality of child care programs for infants and toddlers in eligible families.

An Indian tribe or tribal organization that receives a grant through an allotment for Indian and Native Hawaiian Child Care shall use the grant funds to provide, by the end of FY2026, access to high-quality, culturally and linguistically appropriate child care for infants and toddlers for eligible families in the tribal community.

The Internal Revenue Code is amended to revise rules for the taxation of inverted corporations (i.e., U.S. corporations that acquire foreign companies to reincorporate in a foreign jurisdiction with income tax rates lower than the United States) to provide that a foreign corporation that acquires the properties of a U.S. corporation or partnership after February 10, 2016, shall be treated as an inverted corporation and so subject to U.S. taxation if, after such acquisition, it holds more than 50% of the stock of the new entity (expanded affiliated group).</summary>
