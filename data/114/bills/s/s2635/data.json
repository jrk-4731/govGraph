The plan must include:\n\n the number of heavy and medium polar icebreakers required in the polar regions, the vessel details required for the design of heavy polar icebreakers, the specific appropriations required for the acquisition of each icebreaker, and a description of any polar icebreaking capacity gaps that exist based on the current fleet and procurement outlook. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to submit to Congress, within six months, a report on the international funding models used to sustain the icebreaking fleets of foreign countries in the polar regions or other areas. The report must include:\n\n an analysis of icebreaking activity carried out by foreign countries, an overview of the fees used to compensate foreign countries for icebreaking escorts, the impact of escort fees in the polar regions on the shipping industry, the effectiveness of escort fees in funding foreign icebreaking vessels, and policy recommendations for funding U.S. polar icebreaking vessels."
