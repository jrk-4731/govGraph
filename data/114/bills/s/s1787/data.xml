This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a full-service community schools grant program. A &#8220;full-service community school&#8221; is a public elementary or secondary school that participates in a community-based effort to coordinate, integrate, and provide year-round access to educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services for students, families, and the community.

ED must require each grant recipient to provide matching funds based on a sliding scale that accounts for the grantee&#8217;s ability to obtain matching funds and the relative poverty of the grantee&#8217;s targeted population. However, ED may not consider an applicant&#8217;s ability to match funds when determining which applicants will be awarded grants under the program. The duration of each renewable grant is five years.

With respect to program guidance, the bill also establishes principles of effectiveness as well as a Full-Service Community Schools Advisory Committee.</summary>
