  <summary date="2015-04-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to review the potential of other federal agencies' pending rulemaking proceedings to cause an adverse effect on the cost, time, or difficulty of complying with DOE's current or proposed energy efficiency regulations, guidelines, or standards.

DOE must consult with federal agency heads to identify areas of conflict or overlap between any of its proposed or final regulations, guidelines, or standards and relevant agencies' proposed or final regulations, guidelines, or standards. DOE must also seek public input on any identified conflicts or overlaps.

When there is an identified conflict or overlap, DOE must work with the head of the relevant agency and the public to resolve the conflict or overlap prior to finalizing a rulemaking to ensure that the conflict or overlap does not pose an undue compliance burden on the regulated persons.</summary>
