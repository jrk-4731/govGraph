Prescribed Burn Approval Act of 2016

(Sec. 3) This bill prohibits the Forest Service from authorizing a prescribed burn (i.e., a planned fire intentionally ignited) on Forest Service land if, for the county or contiguous county in which such land is located, the national fire danger rating system is indicating an extreme fire danger level.

Nonetheless, the Forest Service may authorize a prescribed burn under such a condition if it coordinates with the applicable state government and local fire officials.

At the end of every fiscal year, the Forest Service shall submit a report that describes:

 the number and locations of prescribed burns during that fiscal year, and each prescribed burn during that year that was authorized by the Forest Service as an exception under this bill.</summary>
