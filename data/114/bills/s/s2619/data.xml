This bill directs the Department of Commerce to carry out a one-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of awarding financial assistance of up to $120,000, on a competitive basis, to up to 10 local governments to support the development of startup businesses.

Such a local government must represent a population of 200,000 or less and be eligible to participate in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research ("EPSCoR") of the National Science Foundation.

An eligible startup business must be under the local government's jurisdiction, have fewer than five full-time employees, and intend to produce a technology or product that may result in intellectual property vesting in an entity of the United States that can commercialize the technology in a timely manner.

Each local government receiving a grant shall ensure that the financial assistance it gives to a startup is used to assist with direct costs related to successfully growing a business.</summary>
