  <summary date="2015-01-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Directs the Secretary of Energy to ensure that any crude oil and bitumen transported into the United States by the Keystone XL pipeline, and all refined petroleum fuel products originating from that crude oil or bitumen, will be entered into domestic commerce in the United States for use as fuel or the manufacture of another product.

Authorizes the President to waive such requirement in the national interest in specified circumstances, including where: (1) an exchange of crude oil or refined product provides for no net loss of crude oil or refined product consumed domestically; or (2) a waiver is necessary under the Constitution, a law, or an international agreement.</summary>
