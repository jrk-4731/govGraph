  <summary date="2016-04-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Johnson-O'Malley Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act

This bill amends the Johnson-O'Malley Act to establish a program through which the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) shall contract with eligible entities for the purpose of providing educational benefits to Indian students. An eligible entity is an entity that educates or serves Indian students and is either an&#160;Indian tribe, a&#160;tribal organization, an Indian corporation, a school district, a state, or a consortium of any of these entities.

An eligible entity shall use the funds to establish or expand programs to: (1) provide remedial instruction, counseling, cultural programs, school supplies, and specified courses and activities; (2) establish targeted, culturally sensitive, dropout prevention activities; and (3) purchase equipment to facilitate training in trade skills and college preparation.

In general, BIA shall base the amount of a contract on the number of eligible Indian students educated or served by an eligible entity.

With respect to these contracts, BIA must ensure full geographic coverage and the full participation of eligible entities.</summary>
