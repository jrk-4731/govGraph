Representative Payee Fraud Prevention Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Prohibits any person authorized by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to receive federal retirement payments on behalf of a minor or an individual of legal disability from embezzling or in any manner converting any amounts from such payments to a use other than for the benefit of such minor or individual.

Considers any willful neglect or refusal to make and file proper accountings or reports concerning such payments as required by law to be prima facie evidence of the embezzlement or prohibited conversion of such amounts.

Prohibits OPM from authorizing a person to receive payments on behalf of a minor or individual of legal disability if that person has been convicted of: (1) a violation of this Act, (2) fraud under the Social Security Act, or (3) misappropriation as a fiduciary under veterans' benefits provisions.</summary>
