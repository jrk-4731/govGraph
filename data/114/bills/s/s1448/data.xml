(Sec. 4) This bill designates approximately 99,653 acres of Forest Service land in Oregon as the Frank Moore Wild Steelhead Special Management Area. The special management area shall be administered by the Department of the Agriculture, through the Forest Service, to:

 conserve and enhance the natural character, scientific use, and the botanical, recreational, ecological, fish and wildlife, scenic, drinking water, and cultural values of the special management area; maintain and seek to enhance the wild salmonid habitat of the special management area; maintain or enhance the watershed as a thermal refuge for wild salmonids; and preserve opportunities for recreation, including primitive recreation. Nothing in this bill creates any protective perimeter or buffer zone around the special management area.

Nothing in this bill prohibits the Forest Service, in cooperation with other federal, state, and local agencies, from conducting wildland fire operations in the special management area, including the use of aircraft, machinery, mechanized equipment, fire breaks, backfires, and retardant.

Nothing in this bill prohibits the Forest Service from conducting vegetation management projects within the special management area.

Nothing in this bill diminishes any treaty rights of Indian tribes.

The bill withdraws the federal land within the boundaries of the special management area's river segments from:

 entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials.</summary>
