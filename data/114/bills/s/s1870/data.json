Such a group shall be treated as a single veteran.\n\nEach grantee shall: (1) complete an SBA-approved entrepreneurship readiness program, and (2) prepare a business plan.\n\nThe SBA shall submit a program assessment within two years of the program's commencement.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall submit a program evaluation within one year of the program's termination.\n\nNothing in the bill shall be construed to modify any time limitation or period during which an individual is entitled to Post 9/11 or all-volunteer force educational assistance."
