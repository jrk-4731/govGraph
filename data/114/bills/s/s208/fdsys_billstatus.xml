          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Secure the Border First Act of 2015</b></p> <p>Directs the&nbsp;Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to submit Border Security Verification Commission (BSVC) and Government Accountability Office&nbsp;reports, at specified intervals, that assess and describe the state of situational awareness and operational control along the northern and southern U.S. borders. </p> <p>Defines "situational awareness" as knowledge and an understanding of current unlawful cross-border activity, the ability to forecast future shifts in such threats and trends, and the operational capability to conduct continuous and integrated surveillance of such borders.</p> <p>Directs&nbsp;DHS to: (1) submit and implement an operational plan to gain and maintain situational awareness and operational control of high traffic areas within two years after enactment of this Act and operational control and situational awareness along the southern land border of the United States within five years; and (2) notify Congress that such objectives have been obtained and maintained, which notification shall be certified by the BSVC.</p> <p>Specifies: (1) additional capabilities to be deployed to the San Diego, El Centro, Yuma, Tucson, El Paso, Big Bend, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley sectors and the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean and Gulf Maritime regions to achieve situational awareness and operational control of the southern border; (2) fencing to be constructed or replaced in the Border Patrol's San Diego, El Centro, Yuma, Tucson, Rio Grande Valley, El Centro, Yuma, El Paso, and Big Bend sectors; (3) road construction or maintenance projects to be completed in the San Diego, El Centro, Yuma, Tucson, Big Bend, El Paso, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley sectors; (4) boat ramps to be constructed in the Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley sectors; (5) access gates to be constructed in the Rio Grande Valley sector; and (6) forward operating bases to be constructed in the El Paso, Tucson, Big Bend, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande sectors. </p> <p>Directs the Border Patrol to coordinate with the heads of each relevant federal and state agency to eradicate the Carrizo cane plant along the Rio Grande River. </p> <p>Requires the Border Patrol to develop metrics to measure the effectiveness of security at ports of entry, (2) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to develop metrics to measure the effectiveness of security at ports of entry, (3) the Coast Guard and the CBP to jointly implement metrics to measure the effectiveness of security in the maritime environment, and (4) the CBP to implement metrics to measure the effectiveness of security in the aviation environment. Requires the BSVC to assess and the Comptroller General to report on the statistical validity of the data and methodology used to develop such metrics.</p> <p>Establishes the BSVC and a special congressional commission on border security to determine the criteria for recommending the three presidential appointees to the BSVC. Terminates the BSVC after determining the accuracy of the tenth annual metrics submission required under this Act.</p> <p>Directs the&nbsp;Border Patrol&nbsp;to impose a consequence for each alien apprehended pursuant to the Border Patrol's Consequence Delivery System. </p> <p>Authorizes the Border Patrol to alter the capability deployment requirements of this Act upon determining that the principal border security threats require alteration.</p> <p>Authorizes the&nbsp;Department of Defense (DOD) to allocate additional DOD aviation assets to the southern border to assist&nbsp;DHS in achieving situational awareness and operational control.</p> <p>Sets personnel levels for the Border Patrol's active duty agents, CBP's Office of Field Operations officers, and CBP's Office of Air and Marine agents.</p> <p>Requires: (1) DHS to ensure a minimum of not fewer than 130,000 annual flight hours of the Office of Air and Marine, and (2) the Office of Air and Marine to operate unmanned aerial systems not less than 16 hours per day, seven days per week. Requires the Office of Air and Marine to assign the greatest prioritization to support Border Patrol requests to gain and maintain situational awareness and operational control of high traffic areas and operational control and situational awareness along the southern border.</p> <p>Authorizes the Border Patrol to transfer its agents, on a voluntary basis, to high traffic areas and to provide an incentive bonus for any such transfer.</p> <p>Prohibits the Departments of the Interior or Agriculture (USDA) from impeding, prohibiting, or restricting CBP activities on federal land located within 100 miles of the U.S. border with Mexico to execute search and rescue operations, and to prevent all unlawful entries into the United States.</p> <p>Directs DHS: (1) to submit an implementation plan to establish a biometric exit data system to complete the integrated biometric entry and exit data system; (2) within two years after enactment of this Act, to establish a biometric exit data system at the 15 U.S. airports and the 15 U.S. seaports that support the highest volume of international air and sea travel and the 15 U.S. land ports of entry that support the highest volume of pedestrian crossings;
