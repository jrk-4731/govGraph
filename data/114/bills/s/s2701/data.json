    "text": "Medicaid Program Integrity Enhancement Act of 2016\n\nThis bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a state\u00a0Medicaid agency\u00a0to establish a process by which a provider may appeal a decision by the agency to suspend payment to the provider on the basis of credible fraud allegations.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) must revise specified regulations\u00a0related to such suspensions in order to\u00a0comply with due process requirements established by the bill.\n\nSpecifically, a state Medicaid agency may not suspend payment until the agency: (1) consults with the state's Medicaid fraud control unit or, if the state has no such unit, with the state's attorney general; (2) certifies that it has considered whether the suspension will jeopardize beneficiary access and\u00a0whether there is good cause not to suspend payment; and (3) furnishes the provider with the agency's reasons for finding no such good cause.\n\nFurthermore, the agency must periodically evaluate whether there is good cause\u00a0to discontinue\u00a0a suspension for which an investigation is pending. With specified exceptions,\u00a0such good cause\u00a0shall be deemed to exist if the investigation remains unresolved after a suspension has been in effect for 18 months.\n\nCMS must also revise specified regulations to provide that an allegation of fraud shall be considered credible only if the allegation has indications of reliability and\u00a0the state Medicaid agency: (1)\u00a0has reviewed all allegations, facts, and evidence carefully; (2) acts judiciously on a case-by-case basis; and (3) has considered the potential impact a payment suspension may have on beneficiary access to care."
