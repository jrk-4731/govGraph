(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to permit the Food and Drug Administration to allow the sponsor of a new drug or biological product for the treatment of a rare, serious condition to rely upon information submitted for an approved medication that uses the same technology. For a sponsor to be eligible to rely upon submitted information: (1) the sponsor must have developed, or have a right of reference to, the relied upon information; and (2) the new medication must use nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) or similar chemicals, or must affect a disease-causing product of a mutated gene (e.g., the protein that causes cystic fibrosis).</summary>
