  <summary date="2015-07-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Transportation to make grants to assist eligible recipients in financing capital projects to maintain bus and bus facilities systems in a state of good repair, including projects to: (1) replace, rehabilitate, and purchase buses and related equipment; and (2) construct bus-related facilities.

Eligible recipients are designated recipients that operate bus service or that allocate funding to bus operators. Grant recipients may: (1) allocate amounts to subrecipients that are public agencies or private nonprofit organizations engaged in public transportation, and (2) obligate funds for three fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the amount is appropriated.

The bill limits to 4% the percentage of funding made available for this Act in a fiscal year that may be provided to a single recipient.</summary>
