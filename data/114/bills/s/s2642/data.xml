This bill requires each air carrier providing passenger air transportation to train flight attendants and pilots who are employees or contractors of the carrier to combat human trafficking in the course of carrying out their duties. Such training shall cover: (1) common indicators of human trafficking, and (2) best practices for reporting suspected human trafficking to law enforcement officers.

An air carrier may provide such training using modules and materials developed by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including the training modules and associated materials of the Blue Lightning Initiative of the DHS U.S. Customs and Border Protection and subsequent modules and materials developed and recommended by such Departments with respect to combating human trafficking.

The Federal Aviation Administration shall report recommendations for improving the identification and reporting of human trafficking by air carrier personnel while protecting the civil liberties of passengers.

The bill grants immunity to an air carrier for reporting any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation relating to human trafficking.</summary>
