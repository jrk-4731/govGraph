This bill requires the market name of genetically modified (commonly called "GMO") salmon to include "Genetically Engineered" or "GE" in front of the existing market name.

The Department of Health and Human Services must ensure that an independent scientific organization: (1) reviews and reports on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) environmental assessment of AquAdvantage Salmon, and (2) conducts its own environmental assessment of the salmon.

Upon receipt of the report from the independent scientific organization, the FDA must conduct another environmental assessment of the salmon, taking into account the findings in the report.</summary>
