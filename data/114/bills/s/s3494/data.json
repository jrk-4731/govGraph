    "text": "CBP Hiring and Retention Act of 2016 or the CBP HiRe Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to pay a retention bonus to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees performing activities that are critical to border security upon determining that such an employee would otherwise likely leave federal service or leave for a different position.\n\nA retention bonus service agreement shall include the length of required service and the amount and method of payment of the bonus.\n\nDHS may pay a special rate of pay (up to 125% of basic pay) to such CBP employees whose permanent duty stations are located in remote locations or other geographic areas for which finding employees is difficult. Such special pay authority terminates after two years but may be extended for another two years.\n\nIf an applicant for a CBP position does not successfully complete a required polygraph examination, the CBP may not disclose the polygraph results to any other federal agency or DHS component and such other agency or component may not use the results in determining whether to appoint such individual. Such limitations terminate after one year but may be extended for another year.\n\nDHS shall provide each CBP applicant who will be required to successfully complete a polygraph examination before his or her appointment a list of disqualifying actions or conduct of, or events relating to, the applicant."
