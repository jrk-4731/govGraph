Such an individual may, during a specified period, modify or revoke the VA's alternative selection.\n\nThe bill extends the period for certain qualifying work-study activities for individuals receiving VA educational assistance.\n\nSpecified education programs are deemed to be approved for veterans' education benefit purposes if a state approving agency determines that they qualify.\n\nLicensure or certification program requirements necessary for VA approval are revised.\n\nThe Director of a Veterans Integrated Service Network may contract with an entity specializing in civilian accreditation or health care evaluation to investigate any network medical center."
