This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions related to federal civil forfeiture cases. Specifically, the bill:

 raises the evidentiary standard in such cases from "preponderance of the evidence" to "clear and convincing evidence"; with respect to property owners who are indigent, provides for the appointment of counsel; provides for recovery of attorney's fees&#160;with respect to&#160;settled claims in which the claimant prevails; adds notice requirements; and expedites and otherwise modifies certain procedures. The Department of Justice must: (1) annually audit federal civil forfeiture cases, and (2) establish a publicly available database with respect to seizures in such cases.</summary>
