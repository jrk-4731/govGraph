The distributions must be made to an individual: (1) whose principal place of abode on August 11, 2016, is located in the Mississippi River Delta disaster area, and (2) who has sustained an economic loss by reason of the severe storms and flooding giving rise to the Presidential declaration of a major disaster area in Louisiana on or after August 11, 2016, and before September 1, 2016.\n\nA taxpayer who has received such a distribution may: (1) repay the distribution by making additional contributions to a retirement account within three years, and (2) include the distribution in gross income by dividing the amount over a three-year period."
