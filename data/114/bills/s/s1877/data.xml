  <summary date="2015-07-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill directs the Attorney General to request that a division of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia appoint a special prosecutor to: (1) determine whether any action taken by Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any other entity that receives federal funds and conducts abortions or that provides funds to any other entity that conducts abortions violated any federal law relating to abortion, including the inappropriate change of abortion procedure, the use of fetus tissue following an abortion, or the use of federal funds for abortion; and (2) prosecute, if warranted, any such violation.

The bill rescinds the unobligated balance of any federal funds provided to the Planned Parenthood and any affiliate state or local office and makes such amounts available to the special prosecutor to carry out activities under this Act.</summary>
