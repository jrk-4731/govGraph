  <summary date="2015-12-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Verifying Electronically the Receipt of In-Home Care For Individuals Act or the VERIFI Act

This bill amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require the use of electronic visit verification systems for certain services under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. An "electronic visit verification system" is a system under which care-related visits are electronically verified with regard to: (1) the type and date of service, (2) the individual receiving the service, (3) the individual providing the service, (4) the location of service delivery, and (5) the time the service begins and ends.

With respect to the Medicare program,&#160;a home health agency must have such a system in place&#160;for home health services as a condition of participation.

In the case of a state Medicaid program that does not require the use of such a system for both personal care services and home health services, the federal medical assistance percentage for medical assistance expended on such services shall be reduced beginning in 2019. These reductions increase incrementally from 0.25% to 1.00% through 2023.

With respect to the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services shall establish standards for the systems and must consult with agencies to ensure that such standards: (1) are minimally burdensome, (2) account for existing best practices and electronic visit verifications systems already in use, and (3) require that the systems are conducted in accordance with specified legal requirements related to privacy and security.&#160;In regard to&#160;a state Medicaid program, a state shall do the same.</summary>
