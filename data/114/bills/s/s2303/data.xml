  <summary date="2015-11-18T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to exempt national security agencies from sequestration, which is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.

The exemption applies to the Department of Defense, each element of the intelligence community, the Department of State, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Nuclear Security Administration.</summary>
