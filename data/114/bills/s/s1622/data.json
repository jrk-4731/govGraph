(Currently, the FDA is required to consider the least burdensome appropriate means for a sponsor to demonstrate the effectiveness of a medical device or demonstrate a device\u2019s substantial equivalence to an approved medical device.) The FDA must periodically assess the implementation of those requirements. The ombudsman for any applicable unit of the FDA must audit and report on the training.\n\nThe FDA must consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate medical device safety and effectiveness when requesting additional information from a device sponsor to support a premarket approval application, including the role of postmarket information in such a demonstration.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s documented rationale for a significant decision regarding a medical device must include a statement regarding how the least burdensome requirements were considered and applied."
