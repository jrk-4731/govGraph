    "text": "International Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation Through Advanced Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders\n\n This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to establish the Angel Watch Center. The Center must identify outbound sex offender travelers who failed to provide advanced notice of international travel and provide a list of such individuals to the U.S. Marshals Service to investigate.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) must designate the Center as the central repository for incoming notifications of sex offender travel.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Center and the Marshals Service to transmit notification to a destination country of a sex offender's international travel. The Center and the Marshals Service must comply with certain procedures, collect specified data, and establish a complaint process for sex offenders affected by notifications.\n\nIt amends the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to require a registered sex offender to report additional information on intended international travel. In addition, the bill amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime for a sex offender to knowingly fail to report such intended international travel information.\n\nDOJ may notify a destination country of a sex offender's international travel.\n\nThis bill amends the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to prohibit the Department of State from issuing a passport to a sex offender applicant, unless the passport contains a unique identifier. A \"unique identifier\" is any visual sex offender designation that is conspicuously affixed to a passport."
