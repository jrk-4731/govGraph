  <summary date="2015-09-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress on hunger in our communities by resolving that Congress should:

 increase support for programs that will strengthen wages and move the nation toward full employment; increase funding for programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), refundable tax credits, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program); appropriate funds for the Department of Agriculture to operate and manage programs that are authorized as part of the Healthy Food Financing Initiative; permit nonprofit organizations that serve children through the Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Summer Food Service Program to operate one program year-round; and waive the on-site requirement for after-school and summer meals programs to allow communities to develop more effective ways to serve children outside of the school day.</summary>
