 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should encourage a global pediatric clinical trial network through the allocation of grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to supplement the salaries of new and early investigators who participate in it; NIH grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements should be awarded to participating entities, solely for the purpose of supplementing the salaries of such investigators; and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should engage the European Medicines Agency and other foreign regulatory entities during the formation of such network to encourage their participation and should continue to engage such entities, once such network becomes operational, to encourage and facilitate their participation with the goal of enhancing the network's global reach.</summary>
