        <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute numbered 6 printed in House Report 114-49 to increase new budget authority for the Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism function (Function 970) by $2 billion, from $94 billion to $96 billion in Fiscal Year 2016. The amendment increases the outlay amounts for OCO over the period of Fiscal Years 2016 to 2025. As a consequence of the increase in OCO/GWOT, conforming increases are made in total budget authority and outlays, deficits, interest, debt subject to limit, and debt held by the public. The amendment also strikes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism in section 513 of the reported resolution.</purpose>

        <purpose>An amendment numbered 2 printed in House Report 114-49 to make investments in education, job training, transportation and infrastructure, and advanced research and development programs that will help the economic recovery. It includes funding for a comprehensive jobs bill and targeted investments to reduce the poverty in America. The CBC budget protects the social safety net without cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or SNAP. It raises new revenue by making our tax system fairer, saving more than $1.9 trillion on the deficit over the next decade and reduces the annual budget deficit to 2.3% of GDP by FY 2025.</purpose>

        <text>Rule provides for consideration of H. Con. Res. 27 with 4 hours of general debate. Previous question shall be considered as ordered without intervening motions. Measure will be considered read. Specified amendments are in order. The resolution waives all points of order against consideration of the concurrent resolution. The resolution waives all points of order against the amendments printed in the report. The resolution provides that if more than one such amendment is adopted, then only the one receiving the greater number of affirmative votes shall be considered as finally adopted. In the case of a tie for the greater number of affirmative votes, then only the last amendment to receive that number of affirmative votes shall be considered as finally adopted. The resolution permits the chair of the Budget Committee to offer amendments in the House pursuant to section 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to achieve mathematical consistency. The resolution provides that the concurrent resolution shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question of its adoption.</text>

(Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.) </p> <p>(Sec. 202) Requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to use the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) January 2015 baseline when estimating the costs of legislation. Permits the chairman to determine whether adjustments to the baseline made after this resolution is adopted should be used.

Requires the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on legislative changes the committees may make to improve the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of programs within their jurisdiction. </p> <p>TITLE IV--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT </p> <p>(Sec. 401) Requires CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation to incorporate macroeconomic effects in estimates of specified legislation (commonly referred to as dynamic scoring). </p> <p>(Sec. 402) Prohibit Congress from considering legislation in FY2016 that reduces the actuarial balance of the Social Security trust funds below specified levels. </p> <p>(Sec. 403) Provides that the administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the United States Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to ensure that the Committee retains control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process. </p> <p>(Sec. 404) Requires transfers of funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays in the year the transfer occurs. </p> <p>(Sec. 405) Prohibits advanced appropriations unless: (1) the appropriation is provided for an account listed as an exception in the report accompanying this resolution, and (2) total advanced appropriations do not exceed a specified amount. (Under this resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for the fiscal year following FY2016.) </p> <p>(Sec. 406) Requires CBO, upon request of the chairman or ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, to include an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the ''fair value'' of assets and liabilities in estimates for certain federal credit programs under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Permits the chair to use the estimates to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budget enforcement controls. </p> <p>(Sec. 407) Establishes a point of order against legislation with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $5 billion in any of the four consecutive ten-year periods beginning in FY2026. </p> <p>(Sec. 408) Provides the House Appropriations Committee with a separate allocation for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and specifies procedures for enforcing the allocation. </p> <p>(Sec. 409) Authorizes the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust committee allocations and levels in this resolution if legislation decreases direct spending in any fiscal year and authorizes appropriations for the same purpose. </p> <p>(Sec. 410) Sets forth procedures for the adjustment of allocations, aggregates, and other levels included in this resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 411) Affirms that the adoption of the budget resolution is an exercise of the House's rulemaking power and that the House has the constitutional right to change these rules. </p> <p>TITLE V--RESERVE FUNDS </p> <p>Establishes reserve funds that permit the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust the levels and allocations included in the budget resolution to accommodate health, tax reform, trade, education, retirement, transportation, and defense legislation that meets specified conditions. </p> <p>(Sec. 501) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that repeals or modifies the Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. </p> <p>(Sec. 502) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for health care reform legislation that would not increase the deficit over the FY2016-FY2025 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 503) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that repeals Medicare spending decreases included in the Affordable Care Act or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and would not increase the deficit over the FY2016-FY2025 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 504) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for

programs to reduce poverty and increase opportunity and upward mobility, without adversely impacting job creation or increasing the deficit over the period of FY2016 -FY2025. </p> <p>(Sec. 510) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that maintains the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and would not increase the deficit over the FY2016-FY2025 period. </p> <p>(Sec. 511) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that reforms, improves, and updates the federal retirement system and would not increase the deficit over the period of FY2016 -FY2025. </p>
