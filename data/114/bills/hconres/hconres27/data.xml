(Sec. 403) Provides that the administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the United States Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the House Appropriations Committee to ensure that the Committee retains control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process.

(Sec. 404) Requires transfers of funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays in the year the transfer occurs.

(Sec. 405) Prohibits advanced appropriations unless: (1) the appropriation is provided for an account listed as an exception in the report accompanying this resolution, and (2) total advanced appropriations do not exceed a specified amount. (Under this resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for the fiscal year following FY2016.)

(Sec. 406) Requires CBO, upon request of the chairman or ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, to include an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the ''fair value'' of assets and liabilities in estimates for certain federal credit programs under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Permits the chair to use the estimates to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budget enforcement controls.

(Sec. 410) Sets forth procedures for the adjustment of allocations, aggregates, and other levels included in this resolution.

(Sec. 411) Affirms that the adoption of the budget resolution is an exercise of the House's rulemaking power and that the House has the constitutional right to change these rules.

(Sec. 501) Establishes a reserve fund for legislation that repeals or modifies the Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

(Sec. 502) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for health care reform legislation that would not increase the deficit over the FY2016-FY2025 period.

(Sec. 503) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that repeals Medicare spending decreases included in the Affordable Care Act or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and would not increase the deficit over the FY2016-FY2025 period.
