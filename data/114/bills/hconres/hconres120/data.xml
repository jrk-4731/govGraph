  <summary date="2016-04-13T14:18:35Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Permits the Congressional Fire Services Institute and the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation to sponsor the 3rd Annual Fallen Firefighters Congressional Flag Presentation Ceremony as a free public event on the Capitol grounds on September 28, 2016, to honor the firefighters who died in the line of duty in 2015.

Authorizes the Capitol Police Board to allow the sponsor, as part of the event, to use traditional, hand-held fire equipment, such as axes and Pulaski tools, and any other fire equipment that the Board determines can be used in a safe manner and will not cause damage to the Capitol grounds or harm to any individual.</summary>
