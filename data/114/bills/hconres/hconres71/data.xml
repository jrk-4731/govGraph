  <summary date="2015-07-31T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Resolves that Congress must meet its constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense of the United States by restoring spending cuts required by sequestration. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)

Resolves that Congress should enact legislation that:

 restores no less than 75% of the pre-sequester levels established by the Budget Control Act of 2011, offsets the increases in discretionary spending through a combination of reductions to mandatory spending and increases in revenue, includes a Chained Consumer Price Index for Social Security and further means testing for Medicare, and increases revenue by closing tax loopholes and capping deductions for high-income households.</summary>
