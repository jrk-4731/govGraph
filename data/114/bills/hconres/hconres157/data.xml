  <summary date="2016-09-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) any resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process can only come through direct, bilateral negotiations between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority; and (2) the U.S. government, through its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should continue its practice of vetoing any Security Council resolution that unilaterally recognizes a Palestinian state, makes declarations concerning Israeli-controlled territories, or dictates terms for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Expresses support for individuals and organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians dedicated to achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</summary>
