 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Passport Act of 1926 to authorize the Department of State to: (1) refuse to issue a passport to an individual who has aided, assisted, abetted, or otherwise helped a foreign terrorist organization designated pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act; or (2) revoke a passport previously issued to any such individual;

A person whose passport is denied or revoked may request a State Department hearing within 60 days of receiving notice of such action.

 If the State Department refuses to issue or revokes a passport, or if subsequent to a hearing the State Department issues or cancels a revocation of a passport that was the subject of such a hearing, the State Department shall report to Congress within 30 days regarding such action.</summary>
