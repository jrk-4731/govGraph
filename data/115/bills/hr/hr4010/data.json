Specifically, the rules:\n\n allow the action to be filed in a U.S. district court; require expedited disposition of the action and any appeals; and authorize court-imposed monetary penalties against the head of a government agency or component who willfully fails to comply with a congressional subpoena. (Sec. 3) Additionally, the bill amends the Revised Statutes of the United States to establish requirements for the recipient of a subpoena from a congressional committee or subcommittee, including:\n\n to appear and testify or produce records\u2014books, papers, documents, data, or other objects\u2014in a manner consistent with the subpoena; and to provide a privilege log containing certain information about records that are withheld, such as the type of record and the legal basis for withholding it."
