  <summary date="2018-12-22T04:59:58Z" status="Public Law">Sanctioning the Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act

(Sec. 2) This bill states that it shall be U.S. policy to condemn the use of innocent civilians as human shields.

(Sec. 3) The President shall submit to Congress within one year, and annually thereafter, a list of:

 each foreign person that is a member of Hizballah or Hamas or is knowingly acting on behalf of Hizballah or Hamas and knowingly directs the use of civilians protected by the law of war to shield military objectives from attack, and each foreign person or agency or instrumentality of a foreign state that knowingly and materially directs or supports any such act. The President shall impose U.S.-based property-blocking and visa sanctions, including revocation of existing visas, against a listed person, entity, or instrumentality.

The President is urged to submit to Congress within one year, and annually thereafter, a list of each foreign person or entity that knowingly directs the use of civilians protected by the law of war to shield military objectives from attack, excluding those foreign persons included in the most recent mandatory sanctions list.

(Sec. 5) This bill shall cease to be effective on December 31, 2023.</summary>
