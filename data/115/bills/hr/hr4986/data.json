    "text": "Repack Airwaves Yielding Better Access for Users of Modern Services Act of 2018 or the RAY BAUM'S Act of 2018\n\nTITLE I--FCC REAUTHORIZATION\n\n(Sec. 101) This bill reauthorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for FY2019-FY2020. It amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require that\u00a0FCC-collected regulatory fees be credited as offsetting collections. The Department of the Treasury must accept bidding deposits for spectrum auctions held by the FCC; the deposits of successful bidders must be used for deficit reduction.(Sec. 102) Application fees must be assessed at rates to recover costs associated with processing applications; regulatory fees must be assessed to recover the costs of employee pay, other employee benefits, and nondiscretionary costs. Congress must be given notice of adjustments to applications and regulatory fees, but such adjustments are not subject to judicial review. The FCC must assess specified late fees and charge interest on certain fees that are not paid in a timely manner. The FCC may dismiss an application or revoke an instrument of authority held by a licensee for failure to pay fees and penalties in a timely manner.TITLE II--APPLICATION OF ANTIDEFICIENCY ACT\n\n(Sec. 201) The Universal Service Antideficiency Temporary Suspension Act is amended to extend through December 31, 2019, the waiver of certain limitations on: (1) expending, obligating, or apportioning appropriations with respect to federal universal service contributions collected or received under the Communications Act of 1934; and (2) expending or obligating funds attributable to such contributions for universal service support programs.\n\nTITLE III--SECURING ACCESS TO NETWORKS IN DISASTERS\n\n(Sec. 301) The FCC must submit to Congress and publish on the FCC website a study on the public safety benefits, technical feasibility, and cost of providing the public with access to 9-1-1 services during times of emergency when mobile service is unavailable, through:\n\n telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi access points and other communications technologies operating on unlicensed spectrum, without requiring any login credentials; non-telecommunications service provider-owned WiFi access points; and other alternative means. (Sec. 302) The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to expand the categories of essential service providers that may access a disaster site to restore and repair essential services in an emergency or major disaster without being denied or impeded by a federal agency. Services to be considered essential are wireline or mobile telephone service, Internet access service, radio or television broadcasting, cable service, or direct broadcast satellite service.\n\nTITLE IV--FCC CONSOLIDATED REPORTING\n\n(Sec. 401) The bill replaces various reporting requirements with a communications marketplace report that the FCC must publish on its website and submit to Congress every two years. The report must describe the FCC's actions in the marketplace and its agenda for the next two years. The FCC must: (1) consider all forms of competition; (2) compile a list of geographic areas that are not served by any provider of advanced telecommunications capability; and (3) consider market entry barriers for entrepreneurs and small businesses in accordance with national policy favoring diversity of media voices, competition, technological advancement, and promotion of the public interest, convenience, and necessity.TITLE V--ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n(Sec. 501) The bill amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to require the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint the FCC Inspector General. (Currently, the FCC appoints the FCC Inspector General.)\n\n(Sec. 502) The FCC must ensure that its Chief Information Officer has a significant role in: (1) the decision-making process for annual and multi-year planning, programming, budgeting, execution decisions, and reports related to information technology; (2) the management, governance, and oversight processes related to information technology; and (3) the hiring of personnel with information technology responsibilities. The Chief Information Officer must consult with the FCC Chief Financial Officer and budget officials to specify and approve the allocation of amounts appropriated to the FCC for information technology.\n\n(Sec. 503) The bill expands the prohibition against knowingly transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller identification information to apply to: (1) persons outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States, and (2) text messages. Existing caller identification requirements that apply to calls made using a telecommunications service or IP-enabled voice service are revised to apply to: (1) services interconnected with the public switched telephone network and that furnish voice communications using resources from the North American Numbering Plan; and (2) transmissions from a telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to a telephone facsimile machine. The FCC must coordinate with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop and regularly update education materials that help consumers identify: (1) scams and fraudulent activity that rely upon misleading or inaccurate caller identification information, and (2) existing technologies that consumers can use to protect against such fraud.
