  <summary date="2017-11-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Opioid Addiction Prevention Act of 2017

This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from registering, or renewing the registration of, a practitioner who is licensed to prescribe opioids in schedule II, III, or IV unless the practitioner agrees to limit an opioid prescription for the initial treatment of acute pain to the lesser of a seven-day supply (no refill) or an opioid prescription limit established under state law.

An opioid that is approved and prescribed for the treatment of addiction is not subject to the limit.</summary>
