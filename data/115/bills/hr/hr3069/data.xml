  <summary date="2017-06-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Army Arsenal Revitalization Act of 2017

This bill requires the Department of the Army to maintain its military arsenals with sufficient workloads to ensure affordability and technical competence in all critical capability areas by establishing clear, step-by-step, prescriptive guidance on the process for conducting make-or-buy analyses (i.e., whether to manufacture a product in-house or purchase it from a third party), including the use of the organic industrial base. The bill defines "organic industrial base" as U.S. military facilities that advance a vital national security interest by producing necessary materials, munitions, and hardware, including arsenals, depots, and ammunition plants. The bill also requires the Department of Defense to establish a three-year pilot program to permit arsenals to adjust their labor rates charged to customers based upon changes in workload and other factors.</summary>
