When land is in restricted status, it is not subject to taxation and may not be sold or transferred without permission of the Department of the Interior.\n\nUnder current law, the restricted fee status of land allotted to the Five Tribes is maintained only if the individual holding title has at least 50% Indian blood from one of the Five Tribes. This bill removes this requirement. Thus, the restricted fee status is maintained for all lineal descendants of an original enrollee whose name appears on the membership rolls of the Five Tribes."
