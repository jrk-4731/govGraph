The bill specifies the suspension or revocation of an airman certificate as the punitive civil action which may be appealed.\n\nA U.S. district court shall review de novo an FAA denial, suspension, or revocation of an airman certificate.\n\nThe bill prescribes requirements for FAA reexamination of airmen certificates where there are reasonable grounds to question an airman's lack of competence or believe a certificate was obtained through fraud.\n\nThe FAA may not take enforcement action against an individual for violation of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) regarding airspace system information until the FAA certifies its compliance with certain NOTAM Improvement Program requirements.\n\nThe FAA, upon receiving a request for a covered flight record of air traffic data not in its possession, shall request the record from a FAA contract tower or other FAA contractor possessing it.\n\nThe FAA shall revise certain regulations for FAA administrative disposition of a case under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 or the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act to authorize the FAA legal counsel to close covered enforcement actions with a warning notice, letter of correction, or other administrative action."
