(Sec. 2) This bill repeals the expiration date of (thus making permanent) provisions of the Carl Levin and Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 that require: (1) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to make available to the public a list of each major information technology investment made by a covered agency for information technology, including data on cost, schedule, and performance; (2) the Chief Information Officer of each covered agency and the program manager of the investment within the agency to conduct a risk management review of those investments that have received a high risk rating for four consecutive quarters; and (3) the implementation by OMB of a process to assist the covered agencies in reviewing their portfolio of information technology investments.

(Sec. 4) The bill amends such Act to extend the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative through FY2020.</summary>
