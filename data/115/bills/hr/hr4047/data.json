The OMB must issue guidance on improving information sharing by government agencies, including by:\n\n requiring relevant officials to identify and communicate information about high-risk activities; requiring appropriate agency officials to review the reports issued by charge card-issuing banks on questionable transaction activity and suspicious timing or amounts of cash withdrawals or advances; providing for the appropriate sharing of information related to potential questionable transactions, fraud schemes, and high risk activities with the General Services Administration (GSA) and appropriate federal officials; and considering the recommendations made by Inspectors General or the best practices Inspectors General have identified. The GSA and the OMB must establish a purchase and travel charge card data management group to develop and share best practices.\n\nThe GSA shall report on further potential savings opportunities for government agencies under the federal charge card programs."
