DHS is subject to a fine of $1,000 per child for each day such child is not reunited with a parent.\n\nThe bill prohibits an agent or officer of DHS, the Department of Justice, or the Department of Health and Human Services from removing a child from a parent or legal guardian at or near a port of entry or within 100 miles of the border, unless a state court, child welfare agency, or the Chief Patrol Agent or the Area Port Director make findings relating to the best interests of the child or the threat of trafficking or abuse. No such agent or officer may separate a child from a parent or legal guardian solely for the policy goals of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for promoting compliance with civil immigration laws."
