National Strategy for Combating the Financing of Transnational Criminal Organizations Act

(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with various U.S. agencies and departments, to develop a national strategy to combat the financial networks of transnational organized criminals.

Treasury must submit to Congress and regularly update the national strategy.

(Sec. 3) The national strategy must:

 identify and assess the most significant transnational organized crime threats; identify the individuals, entities, and networks that financially support or facilitate transnational organized criminals and assess the scope of such support; assess the methods by which transnational organized crime groups launder illicit proceeds; describe the roles of U.S. agencies and departments to combat the financing and financial facilitation of transnational organized crime groups; and review current efforts and proposed changes to combat the financing or financial facilitation of transnational organized crime.</summary>
