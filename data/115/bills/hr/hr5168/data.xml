USDA may make grants for carrying out or enhancing research with respect to the harvesting of seaweed for voluntary use for the livestock, poultry, and food animal production industries for purposes of the reduction of methane emissions.

The bill also reauthorizes the USDA high-priority research and extension initiatives through FY2023.</summary>
