  <summary date="2017-04-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Best to Use Safety Belts Act of 2017 or the BUS Act of 2017

This bill prohibits a person from manufacturing for sale, selling, introducing into interstate commerce, or importing into the United States a school bus that is not equipped with lap and shoulder belts for each passenger. A violation of this requirement shall be treated as a violation of a federal motor vehicle safety standard.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall establish a program to provide school buses with seat belts and other safety features, under which DOT may make a competitive grant to a state educational agency and a local educational agency to: (1) retrofit a school bus with seat belts, or (2) make another safety upgrade to a school bus that demonstrably decreases the risk of injury or death to students in the event of an impact or rollover.</summary>
