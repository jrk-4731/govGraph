The bill also reauthorizes for FY2019-FY2023 and revises several other programs and entities relating to public health emergencies, including the National Disaster Medical System, the Volunteer Medical Reserve Corps, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\n\nThe bill also expands the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the scope of the National Health Security Strategy.\n\nASPR must also develop a strategy to reunify children and parents who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under a specified immigration enforcement policy (i.e., the \"zero-tolerance\" policy) and submit weekly reports on the status and welfare of children awaiting reunification."
