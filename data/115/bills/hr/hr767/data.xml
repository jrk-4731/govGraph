(Sec. 3) This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a program, to be known as the Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Training Program&#160;or the SOAR to Health and Wellness Training Program, to train health care providers and other related providers to:

 identify potential human trafficking victims, work with law enforcement to report and facilitate communication with such victims, refer victims to social or victims service agencies or organizations, provide such victims with coordinated care tailored to their circumstances, and consider integrating this training with existing training programs. The program must include the functions of the training program with the same name that was operating before this bill's enactment and the following initiatives:

 engaging stakeholders to develop a flexible training module, providing technical assistance to health education programs and health care professional organizations, facilitating the dissemination of best practices, and developing a methodology for collecting and reporting data on the number of human trafficking victims served in health care settings or other related provider settings. (Sec. 4) HHS must report the number of grantees operating under the program, the number of providers trained through the program, and numbers for the program operating before this program.

(Sec. 5) The bill authorizes appropriations for the program through FY2022.</summary>
