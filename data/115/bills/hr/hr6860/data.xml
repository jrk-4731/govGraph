This bill provides that a veteran who meets the length of U.S. Armed Forces service necessary to transfer Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits to a dependent spouse, child, or both may transfer unused benefits to such persons for up to 15 years after discharge or release from the Armed Forces. (Currently, a qualified individual may only transfer such benefits during military service.)

The Department of Defense may not limit eligibility for such benefits based on a maximum number of active service years.

The bill makes these provisions retroactive to August 1, 2009.</summary>
