  <summary date="2017-03-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Comprehensive Strategy to Destroy ISIS Act of 2017

This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State to jointly develop and submit to Congress: (1) a strategy to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and its affiliates, (2) a biennial update of such strategy, and (3) a strategy to bring the civil war in Syria to a sustainable end.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall submit to Congress an assessment of:

 the willingness and capabilities of coalition members and allies to defeat ISIS with their own military assets; the presence of ISIS or its affiliates in countries other than Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, and Afghanistan; preventing radicalization of citizens of regional countries by ISIS; the number of foreign fighters joining ISIS and tactics to prevent further recruitment; and significant U.S. intelligence gaps concerning ISIS and the ability to carry out a regional strategy to defeat it.</summary>
