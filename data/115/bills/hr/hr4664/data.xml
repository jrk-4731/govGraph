  <summary date="2017-12-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Repeal Insurance Plans of the Multi-State Program Act of 2017 or the RIP MSP Act

This bill repeals a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that allows the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)&#160;to enter into contracts with health insurance issuers to offer multi-state plan options.

OPM must report about&#160;specified&#160;efforts in its process&#160;to wind down the multi-state program.

The bill rescinds specified unobligated funds that were provided to OPM for staffing and administering the multi-state program.</summary>
