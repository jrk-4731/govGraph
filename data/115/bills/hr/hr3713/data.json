The programs must support the development of a health care workforce that maximizes patient and family engagement and improves health outcomes for older adults by integrating geriatrics with primary care and other appropriate specialties. Special emphasis must be placed on providing the primary care workforce with the knowledge and skills to care for older adults and collaborating with community partners to address gaps in health care for older adults.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes and modifies the Geriatric Academic Career Awards program to provide awards to promote the career development of individuals such as academic geriatricians or other academic geriatrics health professionals."
