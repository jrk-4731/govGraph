  <summary date="2017-09-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Geriatrics Workforce and Caregiver Enhancement Act

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and modify Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant programs for geriatrics education and training, including the Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program and the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program.

Among other modifications, the bill directs HHS to award grants to health professional schools or programs for the establishment or operation of geriatric workforce enhancement programs that meet certain requirements. The programs must support the development of a health care workforce that maximizes patient and family engagement and improves health outcomes for older adults by integrating geriatrics with primary care and other appropriate specialties. Special emphasis must be placed on providing the primary care workforce with the knowledge and skills to care for older adults and collaborating with community partners to address gaps in health care for older adults.

The bill also reauthorizes and modifies the Geriatric Academic Career Awards program to provide awards to promote the career development of individuals such as academic geriatricians or other academic geriatrics health professionals.</summary>
