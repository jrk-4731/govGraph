(Sec. 3) DHS shall submit to the congressional homeland security committees a plan to enhance the effectiveness of DHS personnel at foreign locations, which shall include proposals to:\n\n improve efforts of DHS personnel for purposes of providing foreign partner capacity development and furthering DHS's counterterrorism mission; redeploy DHS personnel to respond to changing threats to the United States; enhance collaboration among DHS personnel at foreign locations, other federal personnel at foreign locations, and foreign partners; improve the communication of counterterrorism information between DHS personnel at foreign locations and DHS entities in the United States; and maintain practices to guard against counter-espionage threats associated with DHS personnel. (Sec. 4) The briefing requirement shall terminate four years after the submission of the three-year strategy for DHS international programs."
