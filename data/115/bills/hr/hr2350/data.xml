This bill amends the Small Business Act to require the Small Business Administration to make available a secured electronic system through which each agency shall provide access to documents relating to each construction contract it awards to a small business concern, including:

 any payment bond provided for the contract and any bond modification required by the agency; and the date and amount of each payment made to the prime contractor, any amounts withheld, and a general explanation of why an amount was withheld. The bill requires that such documents be made available in such system within 15 days after they are included in the contract file.

For solicitations for the award of a construction contract anticipated to be awarded to a small business concern, the agency shall provide a notice along with the solicitation about the agency's required policies or practices relating to the timely definitization of requests for an equitable adjustment.</summary>
