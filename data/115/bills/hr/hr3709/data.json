    "text": "America's College Promise Act of 2017\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to states and Indian tribes to waive tuition and fees at community colleges. To receive a grant, states and Indian tribes must agree to waive tuition and fees at all their community colleges and for all eligible students.\n\nAn eligible student is a student who: (1) qualifies for resident tuition, (2) enrolls in the college and attends at least half-time, (3) maintains satisfactory academic progress, and (4) enrolls in an academic program with credits that are fully transferable to any public institution of higher education in the state or enrolls in a training program that leads to credentials in an in-demand industry.\n\nThe bill appropriates $1.5 billion in FY2018, an increasing annual amount through FY2026, and $15.7 billion for FY2027 and each succeeding fiscal year for grants under this community college program.\n\nThis bill also requires ED to award grants to four-year historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to waive or reduce tuition and fees for up to 60 credits for low-income students.\n\nHBCUs and MSIs that participate must: (1) enroll a student body that contains at least 35% low-income students; (2) maintain or adopt reforms and practices to improve completion rates and student outcomes; (3) set performance goals; and (4) execute an articulation agreement with community colleges, if accepting transfer students.\n\nIt appropriates $61 million for FY2018, an increasing annual amount through FY2026, and $1.6 billion for FY2027 and each succeeding fiscal year for grants under this HBCU/MSI program."
