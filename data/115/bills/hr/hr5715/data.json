The CMS must disseminate and report certain collected information to such plans, including information regarding providers that\u00a0were referred through the portal and trends in identifying suspicious activity.\n\nAdditionally, for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, MA organizations must submit information to the CMS regarding investigations or other actions taken by MA plans against providers that\u00a0prescribe high volumes of opioids (as determined\u00a0by the CMS)."
