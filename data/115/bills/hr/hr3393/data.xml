  <summary date="2017-07-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">New Collar Jobs Act of 2017

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish an employee&#160;cybersecurity education tax credit, not to exceed $5,000&#160;a year per employee,&#160;for an employer&#160;who incurs costs for an employee who earns a certificate or degree at the undergraduate or graduate level or an industry-recognized certification listed in the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education's Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation is amended to&#160;provide a business that utilizes the employee cybersecurity education tax credit and submits a bid for a competitive federal contract valued at more than $5 million a 5% increase in the business's&#160;bid score.

The bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education to cancel eligible&#160;Federal Direct Loans&#160;for borrowers who have: (1) made 36 consecutive monthly payments, and (2) held a cybersecurity job in an economically distressed area during at least 12 months of payments. The program&#160;will&#160;cancel up to $25,000 in loans.

The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 is amended to include teaching cybersecurity as an acceptable employment&#160;option to satisfy&#160;post-award obligations&#160;for recipients of a CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service award.</summary>
