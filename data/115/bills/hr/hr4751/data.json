USDA must establish a goals and assessment process for conservation programs that includes:\n\n the identification of natural resource and environmental objectives, outcomes, and results for the programs; assessments of the resulting changes in the status and conditions of natural resource and the environment; and a monitoring and evaluation process for the programs and initiatives. In implementing the monitoring and evaluation process, USDA must use certain funds provided for conservation programs and establish a National Technical Committee. USDA may enter into cooperative agreements with government agencies, universities and colleges, and nongovernmental organizations to assist in implementing the monitoring and evaluation process.\n\nThe bill also sets forth reporting requirements regarding the progress conservation programs have made in achieving the objectives and outcomes."
