(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to facilitate increased information sharing about cybersecurity among maritime interests.

DHS must:

 develop, implement, and&#160;continually&#160;review&#160;a maritime cybersecurity&#160;risk assessment model&#160;to evaluate current and future cybersecurity risks; seek input from at least one information sharing and analysis organization representing maritime interests in the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center; establish voluntary reporting guidelines for maritime-related cybersecurity risks and incidents; and request that the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee report and make recommendations to DHS about methods to enhance cybersecurity and information sharing among security stakeholders from federal, state, local, and tribal governments; public safety and emergency response agencies; law enforcement and security organizations; maritime industry participants; port owners and operators; and maritime terminal owners and operators. (Sec. 3) Through the Coast Guard, DHS must also:

 direct each Area Maritime Security Advisory Committee to facilitate the sharing of information about, and development of plans to address, port-specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities; and&#160; require that area maritime transportation&#160;security plans and vessel and facility security plans approved after enactment of this Act&#160;include mitigation measures to prevent, manage, and respond to cyber threats and vulnerabilities. (Sec. 4) The bill amends the federal shipping codes to include cybersecurity in facility and vessel vulnerability assessments.</summary>
