  <summary date="2018-02-27T14:16:28Z" status="Passed House amended">(Sec. 1) This bill specifies that a&#160;federal banking agency may not establish an operational-risk capital requirement for banking organizations unless the requirement: (1) is based on, and is appropriately sensitive to, current risks; (2) is determined under a forward-looking assessment of potential losses; and (3) allows certain adjustments.

(Sec. 2) The bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to lower the maximum allowable amount of&#160;surplus funds of the Federal Reserve banks.</summary>
