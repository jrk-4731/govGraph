  <summary date="2017-06-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fostering Unity Against Russian Aggression Act of 2017

This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Russian Federation should return to verifiable compliance with the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF) Treaty, (2) concerns persist over the growing sophistication of unconventional and hybrid state-sponsored Russian threats, and (3) maritime capabilities should be enhanced.

The Department of Defense (DOD) shall: (1) develop a strategy to counter Russian threats; (2) develop a strategy to increase conventional precision strike weapon stockpiles in the U.S. European Command's areas of responsibility, including increases to enhance deterrence and fighting capability of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; (3) develop a plan to counter Russian military capabilities; (4) develop a plan to train the national security forces of U.S. allies and partners to counter Russian cyberspace and information operations; (5) report to Congress regarding DOD's strategy to expand the forward presence of U.S. military forces in Europe; (6) submit a plan to Congress that includes options to reduce the risk of miscalculation and unintended consequences that could precipitate a nuclear war; and (7) report to Congress regarding the location and capacities of training areas in the European Command's areas of responsibility.

The President shall submit a plan to Congress to impose sanctions against Russia for non-compliance with the INF Treaty. Such sanctions should include expanding asset freezes and travel bans and prohibiting financial transactions and government-to-government contracts.</summary>
