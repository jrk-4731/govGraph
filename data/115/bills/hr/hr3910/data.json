    "text": "This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow distributions from certain tax-favored employer-sponsored retirement plans if a lifetime income investment or managed account investment is no longer authorized to be held as an investment option under the plan.\n\nIf a lifetime income or managed account investment is no longer authorized to be held as an investment option under the plan, the bill allows: (1) qualified distributions of a lifetime income investment or a managed account investment, or (2) distributions of a lifetime income investment in the form of a qualified plan distribution annuity contract.\n\nA \"qualified distribution\" is a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an eligible retirement plan. A \"qualified plan distribution annuity contract\" is an annuity contract purchased for a participant and distributed to the participant by an employer-sponsored retirement plan."
