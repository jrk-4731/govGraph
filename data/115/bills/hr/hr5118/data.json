    "text": "USAccounts: Investing in America's Future Act of 2018\n\nThis bill establishes in the Treasury the USAccount Fund from which the Department of the Treasury must make an initial $500 automatic contribution and subsequent matching contributions of up to $500 annually to accounts known as USAccounts.\n\nUSAccounts shall be established under this bill for individuals born after December 31, 2018, who have not yet attained age 18. The bill provides for contributions by the government and the private sector to such USAccounts\u00a0and allows tax-exempt distributions from such accounts\u00a0for higher education expenses and for funding the individual retirement accounts of an account holder, but prohibits any distributions before an account holder reaches age 18.\n\nThe bill establishes in the executive branch a USAccount Fund Board to\u00a0manage investments in the USAccount Fund.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exempt the USAccount Fund and USAccounts from income taxation, (2) increase the amount of the child tax credit by the applicable USAccount contribution amount, and (3) require the Internal Revenue Service to notify taxpayers of their potential eligibility for the earned income tax credit."
