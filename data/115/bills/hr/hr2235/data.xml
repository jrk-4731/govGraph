This bill directs the Department of Transportation to issue or revise regulations to ensure that:

 a passenger, after boarding an aircraft for a flight, is not subjected to the use of force or involuntary removal unless directly necessary for safety or security; air carriers resolve all overbooking issues prior to beginning boarding for a flight; and air carriers, before an individual is involuntarily denied boarding, make a compensation offer to any individual willing to voluntarily forgo boarding that is at least the maximum compensation amount required under federal regulations for passengers denied boarding voluntarily.</summary>
