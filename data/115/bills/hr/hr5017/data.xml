  <summary date="2018-02-14T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Healthy Food Financing Initiative Reauthorization Act of 2018 

This bill amends the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 to reauthorize and modify the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. The initiative authorizes the Department of Agriculture to provide financial and technical assistance to food retailers, farmers markets, cooperatives, and other entities for projects to improve access to healthy food in underserved communities.

The purposes of the initiative include:

 improving access to, and expanding the supply of, healthy food in low-income, underserved communities; creating and preserving quality jobs and businesses; revitalizing distressed rural, urban, and small town economies; supporting the development of local and regional food systems; increasing the distribution of locally produced agricultural products; and strengthening farm-to-consumer relationships.</summary>
