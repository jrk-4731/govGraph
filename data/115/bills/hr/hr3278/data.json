Insurers are exempted from any secondary state's laws that would prohibit or regulate the operation of the insurer in that state. The primary state is given sole jurisdiction to enforce its covered laws in any secondary state.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must study the effect of this bill on specified health insurance issues."
