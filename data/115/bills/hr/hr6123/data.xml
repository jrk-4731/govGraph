This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow alien physicians who are approved by a state licensing authority to practice medicine in an area having a shortage of health care professionals to engage in medical practice without having to pass the otherwise required medical board examination. The bill also grants such physicians and family members conditional permanent resident status.</summary>
