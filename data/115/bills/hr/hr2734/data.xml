This bill requires the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to withdraw tariff concessions granted to a foreign country if the Department of Commerce determines that such country has not reduced or eliminated a tariff or nontariff barrier on U.S. exports in accordance with a trade agreement.

Commerce must: (1) initiate an investigation if it receives a petition alleging that a foreign country has not complied with the tariff provisions of a trade agreement, and (2) identify each country (other than a least developed country) whose imports of goods and services to the United States exceed twice the value of U.S. exports to that country over a six month period. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection must bar the importation of products from such a country unless a waiver is granted for such products to a U.S. manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler.</summary>
