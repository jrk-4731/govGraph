If the employer had no qualified training expenditures in any one of the three previous years, the credit is equal to 10% of the expenditures for the year.\n\nThe credit applies to expenditures for the training of non-highly compensated employees (annual compensation does not exceed $82,000). The training must result in the attainment of a recognized postsecondary credential and be provided through:\n\n an apprenticeship program in an emerging industry; a program of training services that is included on a list of eligible training providers that states are required to maintain under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act; a program which is conducted by an area career and technical education school, a community college, or a labor organization; or a program which is sponsored and administered by an employer, industry trade association, industry or sector partnership, or labor organization. Certain small businesses and tax-exempt organizations may apply the credit against payroll taxes, subject to specified limits and requirements. Eligible small businesses may also apply the credit against the alternative minimum tax."
