This bill provides that a veteran who meets the length of U.S. Armed Forces service necessary to transfer Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits to a dependent spouse, child, or both may transfer unused benefits to such persons for up to 15 years after discharge or release from the Armed Forces. (Currently, a qualified individual may only transfer such benefits during military service.)

The bill makes these provisions retroactive to January 1, 2009.

The Department of Defense may not limit eligibility for such benefits based on a maximum number of active service years.</summary>
