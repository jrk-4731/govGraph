This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Department of Education (ED) to make publicly available on the College Navigator website certain employment and earnings information provided by schools.

 IHEs must also disseminate to prospective and enrolled students information about the median earnings of their former students, disaggregated by program of study and by completion status of such students, based on data from federal or state agencies.</summary>
