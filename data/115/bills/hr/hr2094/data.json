    "text": "Lead Free Schools Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise national primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper within nine months. The revised regulations must ensure that:\n\n corrosion controls are reevaluated anytime source water or treatment is changed; test results are valid by prohibiting techniques that artificially lower lead levels; monitoring includes school sites for all public water systems serving schools; notification of lead problems is clear and effective; and lead service lines, which are controlled by public water systems, are fully replaced on a set timetable and whenever contamination is detected. The EPA must: (1) publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for perfluorinated compounds within two years, and (2) determine whether to regulate 1,4-dioxane within two years.\n\nThe EPA must establish a grant program for replacing drinking water fountains manufactured prior to 1988 that are located in schools or day care facilities with fountains that are lead free.\n\n The bill reauthorizes for FY2018-FY2022 the voluntary school and child care program lead testing grant program."
