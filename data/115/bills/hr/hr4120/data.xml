  <summary date="2017-10-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Grid Cybersecurity Research and Development Act

This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE)to develop an initiative to mitigate the consequences on the electric grid from the results of cyberattacks by increasing cybersecurity capabilities of the electricity sector.

Additionally, DOE must collaborate with other federal agencies, state agencies, and the private sector to develop guidance for research and demonstration activities to improve cybersecurity capabilities of the electricity sector.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology must develop voluntary cybersecurity training standards that minimize duplication and maintain a public database of cybersecurity training programs.

The Energy Sector Government Coordinating Council must develop a coordinated interagency strategic plan to advance cybersecurity capabilities in the electricity sector.</summary>
