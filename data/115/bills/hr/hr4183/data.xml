  <summary date="2017-10-31T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Domestic Violence Records Reporting Improvement Act of 2017

This bill amends the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to require a state, as an eligibility condition to receive a grant under the National Criminal History Improvement Program, to provide to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) a certain percentage&#160;of records related to domestic violence convictions and protection orders.

Additionally, the bill amends the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 to waive the requirement for a state to certify, as an eligibility condition to receive a grant under the NICS Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP), that it has a relief from disabilities program, if the state's primary purpose for the NARIP grant is to improve access to domestic violence records in the NICS.</summary>
