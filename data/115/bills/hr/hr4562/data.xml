This bill directs the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to exempt banks with assets not greater than $50 billion from certain international financial standards.

The bill amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to create an exemption from internal control report attestation requirements for depository institutions with assets not greater than $1 billion.

The Securities and Exchange Commission must revise Regulation D (which exempts certain offerings from securities registration requirements) to raise the limit on the number of purchasers of securities.

The FRB is directed to increase, from $1 billion to&#160;$3 billion,&#160;the consolidated asset threshold (i.e., permissible&#160;debt level) for a bank holding company&#160;or savings and loan holding company that: (1) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities; (2) does not conduct significant off-balance-sheet activities; and (3) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities, other than trust-preferred securities, outstanding. If warranted for supervisory purposes, the FRB may exclude a company from this threshold increase.</summary>
