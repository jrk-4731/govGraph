This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to use at least 5% of the amounts made available for rental assistance under the low-income housing assistance program to carry out a rental assistance and supported housing program, in conjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs, for the benefit of Indian veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and residing in or near an Indian area.

Rental assistance shall be: (1) made available to recipients eligible for housing assistance block grants under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996; and (2) awarded based on need, administrative capacity, and any other funding criteria established by HUD.</summary>
