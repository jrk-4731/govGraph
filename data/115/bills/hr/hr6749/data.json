An institution of higher education that provides a scholarship to a student shall require the student to report to the institution any potential paid work opportunity the student intends to accept. In the case of a student at an institution of higher education who participates as an athlete in a collegiate revenue-generating sport, the institution shall ensure that the student is provided coverage at no cost for any medical costs incurred with respect to any injury attributable to participation in that sport.\n\nA collective bargaining agreement between a professional sports league and a professional players' association entered into shall allow adults to enter the agreement at the same level as other adults with the same experience level in the league."
