The bill also modifies the excise tax on the sale of firearms to exempt the portion of the sale price that is attributable to smart gun technology.\n\n\"Smart gun technology\" is technology (other than a simple mechanical lock) that is designed to (1) prevent a firearm from being fired by any individual other than an authorized user; and (2) convert the firearm from the inoperable condition to the operable condition in less than two seconds after the authorized user makes contact with the firearm, the firearm's arming device, or an external safe or locking device."
