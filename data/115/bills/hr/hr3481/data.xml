This bill amends the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to require the Office of Management and Budget's searchable website on federal awards to allow the public to search for and download the results of audits performed on non-federal entities that expend such awards.

The Department of the Treasury shall coordinate the transfer of the results of any such audit.

The Government Accountability Office must submit either a certification that this bill's requirements have been fully implemented or, if it has not been fully implemented, the status of such implementation.</summary>
