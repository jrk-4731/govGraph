(These disqualifications prevent future participation in certain capital market activities by entities or individuals who have committed misconduct.) Waiver-seeking entities must petition the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and, after a public hearing, the SEC may vote to grant the waiver if it: (1) is in the public interest, (2) is necessary for investor protection, and (3) promotes market integrity.\n\nThe bill also directs the Government Accountability Office to report on the SEC's current waiver process."
