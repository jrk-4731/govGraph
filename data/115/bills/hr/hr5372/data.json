The bill defines a \"bonus\" as amounts paid to an employee other than amounts obligated under an employment contract.\n\nThe bill makes permanent the tax reductions and other provisions for individuals that were enacted in P.L 115-97 (commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nThe bill also:\n\n increases the standard deduction, makes permanent the reduction in the adjusted gross income threshold that must be exceeded before a taxpayer is allowed to claim an itemized deduction for medical expenses, and increases the refundable portion of the child tax credit."
