This bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budget laws to make several changes to the federal budget process.

The changes to the budget process include:

 converting the existing annual budget and appropriations process to a biennial process; changing the calendar period for the federal fiscal year (currently October 1 through September 30) to January 1 through December 31 beginning in 2020; requiring mandatory spending to be subject to the appropriations process beginning in FY2020, with exceptions for Social Security, Medicare, programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and TRICARE; requiring the baseline budget of each department or agency to be assumed to be zero and each proposed expenditure to be justified as if it were a new expenditure; requiring Congress to consider appropriations bills using procedures similar to the existing budget reconciliation process, which includes expedited procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate; withholding pay for Members of Congress if the House and Senate have not jointly agreed to a congressional budget resolution by June 30 of the first year of a Congress; and repealing the existing discretionary spending limits and the sequestration process used to enforce the limits.</summary>
