The prohibition must continue until the President prescribes guidelines to be published in the Federal Register describing prohibited and permissible travel by a cabinet official.\n\nWith regard to permissible travel under the guidelines:\u00a0\n\n scheduling requirements may not be cited except in the case of travel to or from a region covered by\u00a0a declaration of an emergency or\u00a0a major disaster, or for reasons of national security; the unavailability of commercially-available flights may be cited if it is accompanied by a written finding by the President or the Chief of Staff to the President\u00a0issued on a case-by-case basis; and no comprehensive waiver may be allowed for a cabinet official. After the date of publication of the guidelines, any travel by a cabinet official otherwise prohibited must be disclosed to the General Services Administration (GSA). GSA must publish information on the disclosed travel on its public website."
