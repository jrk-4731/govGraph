The FCC must transmit a summary of such reports to Congress and make\u00a0them publicly available.\n\nThe bill requires a U.S.-based foreign media outlet that produces or distributes any video programming for a foreign principal that is or intended to be transmitted by a multichannel video programming distributor (such as cable operators and direct satellite services)\u00a0to U.S. consumers to include a conspicuous statement that the programming is produced or distributed by\u00a0the outlet on behalf of\u00a0its foreign principal. The FCC may define by rule what constitutes a \"conspicuous statement.\""
