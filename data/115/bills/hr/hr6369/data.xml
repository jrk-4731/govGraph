  <summary date="2018-07-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2018

This bill amends the Small Business Act to revise requirements for the award of sole source contracts (contracts awarded without a competitive process) to (1) qualified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses, (2) small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, (3) economically disadvantaged small businesses owned and controlled by women, and (4) small business concerns owned and controlled by women in substantially underrepresented industries.

The Government Accountability Office must evaluate the policies and practices used by the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies to ensure that contracting officers are properly classifying sole-source contracts under procurement programs for businesses owned by women and disabled veterans in the Federal Procurement Data System.</summary>
