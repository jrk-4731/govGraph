This bill requires the retraction and repayment of recruitment and relocation bonuses paid to federal employees who have spent at least 80% of the time they would otherwise be in a duty status on official time. Additionally, a retention bonus may not be paid to any such employee who, for a period of 6 consecutive months of service associated with the bonus, has spent at least 80% of the time they would otherwise be in a duty status on official time. Official time is time spent by federal employees performing representational work for a bargaining unit in lieu of their regularly assigned work.</summary>
