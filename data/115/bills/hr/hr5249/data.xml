  <summary date="2018-03-13T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Olive Oil Consumer Standards Act of 2018 

This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to: (1) report to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on whether an appropriate federal standard of identity for olive oil would be in the interest of consumers, the olive oil industry, and U.S. agriculture; and (2) take the necessary steps to apply for U.S. membership in the International Olive Council.

In preparing the report for the FDA, USDA must consider the citizen petition titled "Standard of Identity for Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil" and filed with the FDA on July 9, 2012.</summary>
