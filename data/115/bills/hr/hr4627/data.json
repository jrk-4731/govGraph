The bill prohibits the use of such grants for the provision to any person of a firearm or training in the use of a firearm.\n\n(Sec. 4) DHS shall submit to the congressional homeland security committees a report on potential terrorism vulnerabilities relating to emerging automotive technologies that support driverless vehicles and the threat such vehicles may pose to people in public spaces. Such report shall also compare any public benefit of such vehicles against any vulnerabilities and threats."
