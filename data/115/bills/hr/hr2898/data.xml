This bill amends the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 to change the official who shall establish, maintain, and appoint the members of resource advisory committees from: (1) the Secretary of Agriculture to the the applicable Regional Forester for land within the National Forest System; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior to the applicable Bureau of Land Management State Director for such portions of the revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant land under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior classified as timberlands and power-site land valuable for timber that shall be managed for permanent forest production.

 Any year of a member's service on such a committee, the majority of which was served during a fiscal year in which the committee's budget was less than $1 million, shall not count as a year of such member's term for purposes of the four-year term limit.

The bill reduces the number of members of each committee, as well as the number representing each specified community interest category.</summary>
