PDP sponsors may limit disclosure to a subset of enrollees (such as those who were prescribed an opioid in the previous two-year period).\n\n(Sec. 3) The bill also requires Medicare medication therapy management programs and MA in-home health risk assessments to include information about the safe disposal of prescription drugs.\n\n(Sec. 4) The bill prohibits inclusion of pain management questions in certain health care system surveys, unless the questions address the risks of opioid use and the availability of non-opioid alternatives."
