The TSA shall submit a strategy for expanding the network based on such recommendations.\n\nThe TSA, in developing the strategy, must consult with other DHS officials to incorporate mission needs across DHS for an expanded domestic explosives detection canine breeding network that can be leveraged to help meet DHS's operational needs. The working group shall terminate two years after submitting the strategy.\n\n(Sec. 4) The TSA shall issue baseline behavioral standards, medical standards, and technical standards for explosives detection canines. Such standards shall be incorporated into all statements of work for the TSA explosives detection canine contracts and reflect the detection capabilities required to effectively mitigate terrorist threats.\n\n(Sec. 5) The requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to the working group."
