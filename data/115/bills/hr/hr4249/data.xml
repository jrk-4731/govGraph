This bill requires a state, as a condition of participation in the Medicaid program, to provide medical assistance to eligible survivors of Hurricane Maria. For a specified coverage period, the federal matching rate shall be 100% with respect to such assistance. Eligibility shall be determined on the basis of specified income standards but without application of any resources test or state-residency requirements.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development shall, upon request from a public housing agency, provide additional funding for specified housing assistance that is necessary as a consequence of a major disaster. The Department of Agriculture shall do the same upon request from either a state or a political subdivision of a state.</summary>
