Eligibility shall be determined on the basis of specified income standards but without application of any resources test or state-residency requirements.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development shall, upon request from a public housing agency, provide additional funding for specified housing assistance that is necessary as a consequence of a major disaster.
