Specifically, for purposes of counting work activities toward the satisfaction of such requirements, the bill:\n\n eliminates the distinction between\u00a0core work activities and other specified work activities\u00a0related to training and education; in general, eliminates\u00a0separate requirements for\u00a0two-parent families and other families; allows partial credit with respect to families that participate in work activities for fewer hours than required; allows\u00a0states to request approval for an alternative work-participation rate calculation; limits, after three months of participation,\u00a0the extent to which job-search activities shall be counted as work activities; modifies requirements for counting secondary-school attendance as work participation; removes from the definition of \"work activities\" the provision of child-care services to an individual who is participating in a community service program; and increases, from 12 to 24 months, the maximum period for which vocational educational training counts a work activities."
