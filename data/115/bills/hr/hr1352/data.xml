This bill&#160;revises mandatory work requirements under the&#160;Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)&#160;program. Specifically, for purposes of counting work activities toward the satisfaction of such requirements, the bill:

 eliminates the distinction between&#160;core work activities and other specified work activities&#160;related to training and education; in general, eliminates&#160;separate requirements for&#160;two-parent families and other families; allows partial credit with respect to families that participate in work activities for fewer hours than required; allows&#160;states to request approval for an alternative work-participation rate calculation; limits, after three months of participation,&#160;the extent to which job-search activities shall be counted as work activities; modifies requirements for counting secondary-school attendance as work participation; removes from the definition of "work activities" the provision of child-care services to an individual who is participating in a community service program; and increases, from 12 to 24 months, the maximum period for which vocational educational training counts a work activities.</summary>
