  <summary date="2017-06-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows a Member of Congress to carry a concealed handgun for any lawful purpose anywhere in the United States, except on the grounds of the White House, wherever the U.S. Secret Service is prohibiting the possession of a firearm, or on an air carrier (unless the Member has successfully completed the federal flight deck officer training program), provided that such Member:

 is carrying the photographic identification issued by a chamber of Congress that identifies him or her as a Member; has been issued a license or permit to carry a concealed handgun by a state or the United States Capitol Police; and is not otherwise prohibited under federal law from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm. The Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police is authorized to issue such a license or permit.

The Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account and the House of Representatives' Members' Representational Allowance may be used to pay for a a Member's participation in the federal flight deck officer training program, which the Department of Homeland Security must make available.</summary>
