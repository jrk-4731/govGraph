Loans may only be used to fund programs relating to the demonstration and deployment of energy storage systems in households, businesses, and communities.\n\nDOE must carry out a technical assistance and grant program for: (1) disseminating information and providing technical assistance directly to nonprofit or for-profit entities so those entities can identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems; and (2) making grants to those entities so that they may contract to obtain technical assistance to identify, evaluate, plan, and design energy storage systems."
