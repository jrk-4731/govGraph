(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate a senior official:

 implement a plan to oversee unannounced inspections at airports of agency actions taken to address TSA employee misconduct, including corrective actions by airport managers and employee removal from federal service; certify to the TSA, on a biannual basis until September 30, 2023, that such unannounced inspections were completed across a sufficient number of airports; review the results of such inspections to identify causes of any variances and overall trends in actions taken in response to employee misconduct and to develop corrective actions and recommendations; implement the corrective actions and any recommendations; and provide the results of such inspections to DHS. Unannounced inspections of certain locations may be consolidated and coordinated with other TSA offices. TSA may extend the time for completing such inspections for up to an additional fiscal year if exigent circumstances warrant.

DHS may review such results to identify trends and make recommendations to the TSA to address employee misconduct. The TSA shall implement such recommendations.</summary>
