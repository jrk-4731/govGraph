    "text": "Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to achieve situational awareness and operational control of the border, including by increasing enforcement personnel.\n\nThe bill provides funding for infrastructure, law enforcement, and border security, including funds for a border wall along the southern border.\n\nThe bill provides for: (1) an Integrated Border Enforcement Team Program within DHS; (2) Tunnel Task Forces; (3) a pilot program on the use of electromagnetic spectrum to support border control operations; (4) a Biometric Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program; (5) construction of new border ports of entry; (6) a biometric exit data system at certain airports, seaports, and land ports of entry; (7) electronic passport screening and biometric matching; and (8) protections for children apprehended at the border from parental separation and for children in DHS custody.\n\nDHS may provide assistance to a foreign country to address migrant flows affecting the United States.\n\nDHS may provide six-year renewable contingent nonimmigrant status for certain aliens who were under the age of 16 when they first entered the United States. Adjustment to immigrant status is provided based on a point system. Children of long-term temporary foreign workers are also eligible for such status adjustment.\n\nDHS may designate certain groups as a criminal gang. Such individuals may not seek asylum, withholding of removal, or temporary protected status.\n\nIndemnification is provided for law enforcement entities sued for complying with DHS detainers. DHS detainer authority is revised.\n\nThe bill creates a private right of action against a state or local jurisdiction that declines to honor a DHS detainer for a convicted illegal alien who then commits murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\n\nThe bill eliminates: (1) the diversity visa program, (2) certain family-based visa categories, and (3) the per-country limit for employment-based immigrants. The per-country limit for family based-immigrants is increased.\n\nAsylum and visa screening provisions are revised."
