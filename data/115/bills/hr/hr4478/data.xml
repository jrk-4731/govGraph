  <summary date="2017-11-29T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017

This bill amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to allow the Department of Justice (DOJ)&#160;to target a U.S. person outside of the United States to acquire foreign intelligence when DOJ has already authorized emergency use of electronic surveillance or a physical search related to such person.

DOJ and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence must submit a written notice to Congress before intentionally collecting abouts communications (communications that contain a reference to but are not directed to or from a facility) relating to surveillance of a non-U.S. person outside the United States.

DOJ shall submit to Congress and the Administrative Office of the United States an annual report with: (1) the total number of applications made and extensions of orders approving electronic surveillance; (2) the total number of such orders and extensions granted, modified, or denied; and (3) the total number of persons who were subject to electronic surveillance conducted under an order or emergency authorization.

Each element of the intelligence community must develop and maintain procedures to respond&#160;to requests for nonpublic information about U.S. persons.

This bill extends&#160;title VII of the&#160;Foreign&#160;Intelligence Surveillance Act&#160;of 1978 through December 31, 2021.

The Government Accountability Office must study the U.S. classified&#160;information&#160;system and the methods by which the intelligence community protects classified information.</summary>
