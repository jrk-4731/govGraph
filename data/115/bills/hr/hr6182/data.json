DHS may not detain an alien family together when detention of an alien child with the child's parent would pose a risk to the child's welfare.\n\nThe Department of Defense shall provide new and existing facilities for the housing and care of alien families. Executive departments and agencies shall also provide appropriate facilities for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry.\n\nThe Department of Justice shall (1) file a request to modify an existing settlement agreement to permit the detention of alien families together during improper entry criminal or removal proceedings, and (2) prioritize the adjudication of cases involving detained family."
