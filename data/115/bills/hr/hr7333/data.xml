This bill provides for the reorganization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including by requiring FEMA to ensure that its Office of Response and Recovery is divided into an Office of Disaster Response and an Office of Disaster Recovery and to report on its ability to support a state managed and locally executed casework management system to coordinate and deliver direct assistance to disaster survivors.

Disaster Recovery Small Business Grant Act

The bill establishes within the Small Business Administration an Office of Disaster Recovery Small Business Grants. It also reauthorizes through FY2029 the temporary reassignment of state and local personnel during a public health emergency.</summary>
