(Sec. 4) The NSF shall develop an I-Corps course to support commercialization-ready participants. The course shall support participants that have completed an I-Corps Teams course and participants that have made the decision to market an innovation.\n\n(Sec. 5) The Government Accountability Office shall evaluate the I-Corps Program, including by assessing the effects of the I-Corps on the commercialization of federally funded research and development, the higher education system, regional economies, and the national economy.\n\n(Sec. 6) The bill authorizes funding through FY2020 for participation by SBIR grantees and other entities in the I-Corps program and for the development of an I-Corps course to support commercialization-ready participants."
