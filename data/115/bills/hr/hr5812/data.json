Among other changes, the bill: (1) repeals requirements regarding grant formulas, database standards, and authorized data disclosures; and (2) authorizes federal support for specific improvements regarding use, data reporting, and intrastate and interstate interoperability. The Department of Health and Human Services must report on the progress of states in implementing PDMPs that are consistent with such improvements."
