(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide states with guidance and technical assistance regarding their plans under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act for assuring the safe care of infants affected by prenatal substance use.

The guidance and technical assistance must:

 enhance states' understanding of the Act; address the challenges of developing, implementing, and monitoring plans of safe care; disseminate best practices related to developing and implementing plans of safe care; support collaboration between health care providers, social service agencies, public health agencies, and the child welfare system to promote a family-centered treatment approach; prevent separation and support reunification of families if in the best interests of the child; recommend treatment approaches that are designed to keep infants with their mothers and families; support state efforts to develop technology systems to manage and monitor implementation of plans of safe care; and help states improve the long-term safety and well-being of young children and their families.</summary>
