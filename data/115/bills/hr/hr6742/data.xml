  <summary date="2018-09-25T19:25:00Z" status="Passed House without amendment">Secure Border Communications Act

 (Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ensure that each U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer or agent is equipped with a secure radio or other two-way communication device, supported by system interoperability, that permits communication: (1) between ports of entry and inspection stations; and (2) with other federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement entities.

DHS shall: (1) ensure that U.S. Border Patrol agents in remote mission critical locations and at border checkpoints have multi- or dual-band encrypted portable radios, and (2) acquire radios or other devices with the option to connect to commercial mobile broadband networks for deployment in areas where such networks enhance operations and are cost effective.

DHS may evaluate new or emerging communications technologies to determine their suitability for border security operations.</summary>
