The bill modifies the credit to:\n\n make the credit available for catastrophic qualified health plans and plans that are not offered through an exchange, but otherwise meet the requirements for qualified health plans; prohibit advance payments of the credit from being made for a health plan that is not enrolled in through an exchange; and prohibit the credit from being used for health plans that cover abortions (other than abortions necessary to save the life of the mother or abortions with respect to a pregnancy that is the result of an act of rape or incest). The bill also modifies the requirements for minimum essential health benefits to allow all individuals purchasing health insurance in the individual market to purchase a lower premium catastrophic plan.
