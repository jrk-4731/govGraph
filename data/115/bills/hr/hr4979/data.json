(The competitive need limitation terminates duty-free treatment with respect to articles from a beneficiary developing country if certain import limits are exceeded.)\n\n(Sec. 3) The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 is amended to extend through August 1, 2027, the authority for customs user fees for the processing of merchandise formally entered or released into the United States."
