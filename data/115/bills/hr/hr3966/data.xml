This bill revises coastwise laws, commonly known as the Jones Act, that govern domestic transportation of merchandise or passengers by vessels.The Jones Act requires vessels transporting merchandise or passengers between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports be built in the United States, at least 75% owned by U.S. citizens, and mostly crewed by U.S. citizens.

The bill exempts for five years vessels transporting merchandise between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports from Jones Act requirements.

The Government Accountability Office must report the economic impact of this bill on Puerto Rico.</summary>
