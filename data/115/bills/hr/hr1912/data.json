Labor must also authorize a computerized tomography scan in diagnosing complicated pneumoconiosis.\n\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health must establish a pilot program to ensure accurate classifications of chest radiographs in black lung cases where the diagnosis is at issue.\n\nLabor must educate certain individuals who work on black lung benefits about medical evidence relevant to claims.\n\nA previously denied claimant may file a new claim for black lung benefits within one year.\n\nThis bill amends the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to direct Labor to use data from continuous personal dust monitors to determine whether to make changes to respirable dust concentration standards, controls, and measurements.\n\nThis bill provides statutory authority for the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs."
