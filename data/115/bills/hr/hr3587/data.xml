This bill authorizes the intelligence community to collect and report on efforts by foreign powers to: (1) influence the President; Vice President; and family members of the President and Vice President, including in-laws; and (2) provide favorable treatment to the Trump Organization or other businesses or organizations with financial ties to the President, Vice President,&#160;and their families (covered businesses or organizations).
