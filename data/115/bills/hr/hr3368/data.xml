  <summary date="2017-07-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), beginning January 1, 2018, to provide assistance to qualified veterans to obtain child care so that such veterans can receive health care services at a VA health care facility during the time such a veteran requires travel to and return from such facility.

A "qualified veteran" is defined as a veteran who is the primary caretaker of a child and is: (1) receiving from the VA regular mental health care services, intensive mental health care services, or other intensive health care services such that the VA determines that providing assistance to the veteran to obtain child care would improve the veteran's access to such services, or (2) in need of regular or intensive mental health care services from the VA and, but for lack of child care services, would receive such health care services from the VA.

 The VA shall carry out this bill using funds made available to the VA facility that provides the health care services for which the child care assistance is provided.</summary>
