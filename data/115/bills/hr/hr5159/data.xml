  <summary date="2018-03-05T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Clean Coal Jobs Act of 2018 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the refined coal production tax credit and modify the tax credit for advanced coal projects.

The bill extends the refined coal production tax credit for certain refined coal production facilities that do not produce steel industry fuel. With respect to these facilities, the bill extends the placed-in-service date to allow facilities placed in service in 2018, 2019, and 2020 to claim the credit. It also allows facilities that were placed in service after the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (i.e., October 22, 2004), and before January 1, 2012, to claim the credit for an additional 10 years.

The bill modifies the tax credit for advanced coal projects to: (1) lower the carbon dioxide sequestration requirement to 60% for electrical generating units in existence on October 3, 2008, and (2) revise certain technology and environmental performance requirements.</summary>
