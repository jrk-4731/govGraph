    "text": "This bill simplifies the naturalization process for persons born in an outlying possession of the United States (American Samoa and Swains Island). Such persons are U.S. nationals rather than U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth in an outlying possession.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to permit a person to naturalize based upon residency in American Samoa. (Currently, a person from American Samoa must become a state resident in order to naturalize.)\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security may, with respect to an applicant: (1) administer the citizenship process (applications, filings, interviews, oaths, and ceremonies) in American Samoa, (2) reduce application fees, and (3) waive the personal interview requirement.\n\nSuch applicants are exempted from the naturalization requirement to demonstrate English language and U.S. civics proficiency.\n\nA U.S. citizen parent may apply for naturalization on behalf of a child born in American Samoa.\n\nThe bill provides that no court shall have jurisdiction over any naturalization application filed by or on behalf of a resident of American Samoa."
