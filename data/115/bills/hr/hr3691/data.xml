This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to revise the application of child labor requirements and prohibitions with respect to child performers to specify new limitations on the number of hours such children may be employed at the place of employment.

An employer or contractor may not: (1) employ any child performer unless a trust meeting specified requirements has been established on the child performer's behalf and the employer has obtained the account number of the trust account or other proof of its existence; or (2) compensate a child performer in any form besides cash wages, exclusive of board, lodging, or facilities.

Any employment or contracting of a child performer that is not in accordance with such limitations and requirements shall be treated as oppressive child labor.

Certain work hour restrictions shall not apply to child performers employed in a live theatrical production.

Any individual in a supervisory role with respect to a child performer shall be liable for unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex against a child performer whether or not the individual is employed by or contracted by a covered employer or contractor.

Any child performer aggrieved by unlawful harassment on the basis of sex, or the performer's parent or guardian, may bring a civil action in any federal court of competent jurisdiction to recover equitable relief and compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and attorneys fees.

The employer of an individual who is alleged to have engaged in unlawful harassment on the basis of sex against a child performer shall conduct an internal review of its policies and procedures for protecting child performers and ensuring appropriate compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.</summary>
