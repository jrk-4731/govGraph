Benefits are based on a formula, are paid to participants in the form of life annuities (except for benefits that may be immediately distributed from certain plans with a low value), and may be reduced based on the plan's funded status.\n\nThe plan sponsor must take corrective actions through a realignment program whenever the plan's projected funded ratio is below 120% for the plan year. The realignment program may include measures such as benefit reductions or proposed contribution increases.\n\nA composite plan is not covered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) or required to pay PBGC premiums. The plan sponsors are also not subject to liability for withdrawing from the plan."
