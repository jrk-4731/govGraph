This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow a telecommunications carrier to use funds provided from the Universal Service High Cost program to aid in the restoration of telecommunications capabilities after a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency if the carrier repairs its network as quickly and widely as possible to restore service, and uses such funds only in an area that is substantially unserved by facilities-based providers of residential fixed voice and broadband service that do not receive high cost support funds.</summary>
