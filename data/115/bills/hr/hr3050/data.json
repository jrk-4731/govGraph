In developing an energy security plan, a state must coordinate with entities responsible for maintaining fuel or electric reliability, including public utilities and private energy providers.\n\nUpon request of a state, the Department of Energy (DOE) may provide assistance in the development, implementation, or revision of a state energy security plan.\n\nDOE's authority to carry out this bill's provisions expires on October 31, 2022."
