    "text": "This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration a Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council to undertake information gathering activities, develop technical advice, and present best practices or recommendations to DOT regarding:\n\n labor and employment issues that may be affected by the deployment of highly automated vehicles; the impact of the development and deployment of such vehicles on the environment; protection of consumer privacy and security of information collected by such vehicles; and cabin safety for vehicle passengers and how automated driving systems may impact collision vectors, overall crashworthiness, and the use and placement of airbags, seatbelts, anchor belts, head restraints, and other protective features in the cabin. A \"highly automated vehicle\" is defined as a motor vehicle (excluding a commercial motor vehicle) equipped with an automated driving system.\n\nAn \"automated driving system\" is defined as the hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether such system is limited to a specific operational design domain."
