Additionally, the bill amends the State Justice Institute Act of 1984 to allow grant funds awarded by the State Justice Institute to be used to improve the safety and security of state and local courts. Finally, when the General Services Administration disposes of surplus security equipment (e.g., metal detectors), it must give priority to state and local courthouses."
