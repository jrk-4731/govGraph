  <summary date="2018-03-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Local Courthouse Safety Act of 2018 This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize training and technical assistance to help law enforcement agencies anticipate, survive, and respond to violent encounters during the course of their duties, including duties related to security at courthouses. Additionally, the bill amends the State Justice Institute Act of 1984 to allow grant funds awarded by the State Justice Institute to be used to improve the safety and security of state and local courts. Finally, when the General Services Administration disposes of surplus security equipment (e.g., metal detectors), it must give priority to state and local courthouses.</summary>
