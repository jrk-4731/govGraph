  <summary date="2018-06-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to provide that the detention of any alien child who is not an unaccompanied alien child shall be governed by provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act relating to visa waiver program temporary nonimmigrant tourists. There is no presumption that an alien child who is not an unaccompanied alien child should not be detained, and all such determinations shall be in the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS may not release an alien minor who is not an unaccompanied alien child to any individual other than a parent or legal guardian.

DHS shall detain aliens charged with an improper entry misdemeanor with their children under the age of 18 while the charges are pending.</summary>
