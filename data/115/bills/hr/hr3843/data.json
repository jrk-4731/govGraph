Currently, an official act is any decision or action on a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before a public official, in their official capacity.\n\nThis bill broadens an official act to include the personal and substantial participation through, or investigation of, a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy."
