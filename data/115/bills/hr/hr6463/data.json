Specified amounts in the trust fund shall be available, as provided by appropriations Acts, for the federal Highway Trust Fund, grants to low-income households; and other specified energy, environmental, infrastructure, and research and development priorities.\n\nThe bill also\n\n eliminates the federal gas tax, imposes a moratorium on finalizing and enforcing certain Clean Air Act regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and establishes a National Climate Commission to review policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The moratorium on regulations expires in 2033 if specified emission targets are not reached."
