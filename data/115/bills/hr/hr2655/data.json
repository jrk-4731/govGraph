Such training may be provided by the SBA, the USPTO, or SBA development centers (SBDCs): (1) through electronic resources, including Internet-based webinars, and (2) at physical locations, including an SBDC or the headquarters or regional office of the USPTO.\n\nThe bill amends the Small Business Act to require services at an SBDC to include training, developed by the SBA and the USPTO, in person or through a website relating to: (1) domestic and international intellectual property protections, and (2) how such protections should be considered in the business plans and growth strategies of small business concerns."
