This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to: (1) eliminate the Federal Reserve Board's authority to conduct stress tests of nonbank financial companies more than once annually, and (2) exempt certain financial companies not primarily regulated by either a federal banking agency or the Federal Housing Finance Agency from requirements to conduct stress tests.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may issue separate regulations requiring specified financial companies&#160;with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets&#160;to conduct financial-condition analyses.</summary>
