The unclassified portion of the report shall be made available to the public and posted on Treasury's website in downloadable English, Farsi, Arabic, and Azeri versions.\n\n (Sec. 4) It is the sense of Congress that in preparing the reports pursuant to this bill Treasury should consider acquiring information from sources that: (1) collect high-veracity official records; or (2) provide search and analysis tools that enable law enforcement to have new insights into commercial and financial relationships."
