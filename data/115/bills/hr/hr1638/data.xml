 (Sec. 3) This bill requires the Department of the Treasury, in furtherance of efforts to prevent terrorism financing, money laundering, or illicit finance and to make financial institutions' sanctions compliance more easily understood, to report to Congress within 270 days and annually thereafter for the next two years regarding:

 the funds or assets held in U.S. and foreign financial institutions that are controlled by specified Iranian officials; any equity stake such official has in an entity on Treasury's list of Specially Designated Nationals or in any other sanctioned entity; how such funds, assets, or equity interests were acquired and used; new methods used to evade anti-money laundering and related laws, including recommendations to improve techniques to combat illicit uses of the U.S. financial system by each such official; recommendations for revising U.S. economic sanctions against Iran to prevent Iranian officials from using funds or assets to develop and procure ballistic missile technology; how Treasury assesses the effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran; and recommendations for improving Treasury's ability to develop and enforce additional economic sanctions against Iran. The unclassified portion of the report shall be made available to the public and posted on Treasury's website in downloadable English, Farsi, Arabic, and Azeri versions.

 (Sec. 4) It is the sense of Congress that in preparing the reports pursuant to this bill Treasury should consider acquiring information from sources that: (1) collect high-veracity official records; or (2) provide search and analysis tools that enable law enforcement to have new insights into commercial and financial relationships.</summary>
