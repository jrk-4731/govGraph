This bill amends the Social Security Act to create the Medicare Exchange health plan, which the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) must offer in&#160;certain individual health insurance exchanges in 2020 and offer in all individual health insurance exchanges by 2023. Any individual who is a resident of a state where the plan is offered and who is not eligible for Medicare benefits may enroll in the plan. CMS must offer the plan in the small group market&#160;in all areas for 2024.

The plan must meet the same requirements, including essential&#160;health benefits, as health insurance exchange plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Health care providers enrolled under Medicare or under a state Medicaid plan shall also&#160;be participating providers for the plan&#160;and shall be reimbursed at Medicare&#160;rates.

The bill eliminates the restriction on the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare.&#160;</summary>
