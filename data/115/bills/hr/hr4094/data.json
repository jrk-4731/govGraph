Any individual who is a resident of a state where the plan is offered and who is not eligible for Medicare benefits may enroll in the plan. CMS must offer the plan in the small group market\u00a0in all areas for 2024.\n\nThe plan must meet the same requirements, including essential\u00a0health benefits, as health insurance exchange plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealth care providers enrolled under Medicare or under a state Medicaid plan shall also\u00a0be participating providers for the plan\u00a0and shall be reimbursed at Medicare\u00a0rates.\n\nThe bill eliminates the restriction on the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices for Medicare.\u00a0"
