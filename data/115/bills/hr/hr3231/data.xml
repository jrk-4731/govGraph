This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that pregnancy options counseling funded through family planning projects includes adoption counseling and is provided by licensed social workers or counselors who have knowledge and experience in adoption practice. Training for personnel to carry out family planning programs must include training on the adoption process.

Research related to family planning and population must include: (1) collection of data on the number of pregnancy tests administered to individuals served by family planning programs and the results of those tests; and (2) evaluation of the quality, consistency, and outcomes of pregnancy options counseling.</summary>
