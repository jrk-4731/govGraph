The bill requires\u00a0grantees\u00a0to continue\u00a0to track and\u00a0demonstrate, on a triennial basis,\u00a0improvement in applicable benchmark areas. A\u00a0grantee that fails to do so\u00a0must develop and implement a corrective action plan, subject to approval by\u00a0the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS\u00a0shall terminate a\u00a0program grant made to\u00a0a grantee\u00a0that implements such a plan but continues to fail to demonstrate improvement.\n\n(Sec. 104) As a condition\u00a0for receiving grant funds under the program, a state must\u00a0review and update its statewide needs assessment by\u00a0October 1, 2020.\n\n(Sec. 107) A grantee may use\u00a0program grant funds\u00a0to support\u00a0a \"pay-for-outcomes initiative\"\u00a0(a performance-based grant, contract, or cooperative agreement, awarded by a public entity, in which a commitment is made to pay for improved outcomes that result in social\u00a0benefit and\u00a0public-sector cost savings).\n\n(Sec. 108) Grantees must provide matching funds under the program beginning in FY2020.\n\n(Sec. 109) HHS must designate data-exchange standards applicable to the program.\n\n(Sec. 110) To the extent that grant funds are allocated on the basis of relative population or poverty considerations, HHS shall use the most accurate federal data available.\n\n TITLE II--CONTROL UNLAWFUL FUGITIVE FELONS ACT\n\nControl Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017\n\n(Sec. 202) The bill amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the SSAct to prohibit the payment of SSI benefits to an individual who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for: (1) committing, or attempting to commit, a felony; or (2) violating a condition of parole or probation.\n\nCurrent law prohibits the payment of such benefits to an individual who: (1)\u00a0is fleeing to avoid prosecution or confinement for committing, or attempting commit, a felony; or (2) is violating a condition of parole or probation."
