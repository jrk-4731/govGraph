(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a Non-Profit Security Grant Program in the Department of Homeland Security, under which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall make grants to tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations determined to be at risk of a terrorist attack, through the state in which such organizations are located, for target hardening and other security enhancements to protect against terrorist attacks.

Recipients may use grants for:

 target hardening activities, including physical security enhancement equipment and inspection and screening systems; fees for security training relating to physical security and cyber security, target hardening, terrorism awareness, and employee awareness; and any other appropriate activity, including cyber security resilience activities. FEMA shall: (1) make funds provided available for use by a recipient of a grant for a period of not less than 36 months, and (2) report to Congress annually for each of FY2018-FY2022 on the expenditure by each recipient of grant funds made under the Act. Appropriations are authorized for those years to carry out the program, with a specified amount designated for: (1) recipients located in jurisdictions that receive funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative, and (2) recipients located in other jurisdictions.</summary>
