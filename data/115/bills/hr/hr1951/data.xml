  <summary date="2017-04-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No Ongoing Perks Enrichment Act or the NOPE Act

This bill withholds the salaries of Members of a house of Congress that has not agreed to a budget resolution for FY2018 by April 15, 2017, as required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Salaries are withheld from April 16, 2017, until the house of Congress agrees to a budget resolution or the last day of the 115th Congress, whichever is earlier.

The bill amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to eliminate automatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress.

The bill prohibits use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the official travel of a Member of Congress or other officer or employee of the legislative branch for airline accommodations that are not coach-class accommodations. This prohibition shall not apply to an individual if the use would be permitted for an employee of an agency subject to specified federal regulations for temporary duty travel allowances.

The bill amends the federal criminal code to increase to five years the post-employment lobbying ban on a former member of the U.S. Senate (currently, two years) or a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives (currently, one year).</summary>
