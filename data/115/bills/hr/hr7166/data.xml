This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow various tax credits, deductions, and modifications to existing rules for individuals and businesses affected by Hurricane Michael.

With respect to individuals and businesses in the affected areas, the bill:

 waives the 10% additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans for up to $100,000 in distributions made on or after October 9, 2018, and before January 1, 2020; permits individuals to recontribute funds to retirement plans if the funds were distributed for a home purchase in a Hurricane Michael disaster area that was cancelled on account of the hurricane; increases the limit and extends the repayment deadline for loans from retirement plans; allows an employee retention tax credit for a portion of the wages paid to an employee whose principal place of employment on specified dates was in a Hurricane Michael disaster zone; temporarily suspends the limitation on charitable contributions for relief efforts in the Hurricane Michael disaster area; modifies the rules for the deduction for personal casualty losses; and allows taxpayers to use earned income from the immediately preceding year for the purpose of determining earned income for the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit.</summary>
