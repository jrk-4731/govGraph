This bill amends the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to designate public high schools as voter-registration agencies and require them to conduct annual voter-registration drives.

Specifically, a school shall&#160;aim to register&#160;all of its students who are:

 enrolled in a class in American Government or Economics, at least 17 years old as of April 10th of that year, and eligible to register to vote in elections for federal office held in the state. The Department of Education shall reimburse&#160;a school for reasonable costs incurred in carrying out a voter-registration drive.

At a school's&#160;request, the appropriate state election official may agree to provide the school with voting machines and related equipment for use in a student council or similar election held at the school.</summary>
