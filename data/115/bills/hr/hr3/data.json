If Congress does not pass rescission legislation within 45 days of continuous session of Congress, the President must make the funds available.)\n\nThe bill rescinds budget authority from specified programs and accounts within:\n\n the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Treasury, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the Railroad Retirement Board."
