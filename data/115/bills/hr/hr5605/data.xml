  <summary date="2018-06-19T09:02:26Z" status="Passed House amended">Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders in Medicare Act

(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to carry out a demonstration program to: (1) increase access&#160;to opioid-use disorder treatment services for Medicare beneficiaries, (2) improve physical and mental health outcomes for such beneficiaries, and (3) reduce Medicare expenditures.

Opioid-use disorder care teams of practitioners&#160;may apply for participation in the demonstration project. The CMS must establish a performance-based incentive payment for participants.

(Sec. 3) The bill also requires prescriptions for controlled substances that are covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit or Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans to be transmitted via electronic prescription programs. The CMS may waive such requirements under specified circumstances.</summary>
