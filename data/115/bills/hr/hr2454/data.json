DHS shall incorporate into such framework systems capabilities for auditing and ensuring the security of information. Such capabilities shall include: (1) mechanisms for identifying insider threats and security risks; and (2) safeguards for privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.\n\nDHS shall ensure that, by two years after this bill's enactment, the framework has the ability to include appropriate information in existence within DHS to meet its critical mission operations.\n\nDHS shall: (1) submit to Congress regular updates on the status of the data framework until it is fully operational, and (2) annually brief Congress on component use of such framework to support operations that disrupt terrorist activities and incidents in the homeland."
