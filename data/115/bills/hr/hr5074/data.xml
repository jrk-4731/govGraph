(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) national cybersecurity and communications integration center to maintain cyber hunt and incident response teams to provide, upon request, assistance including: (1) assisting asset owners and operators in restoring services following a cyber incident; (2) identifying cybersecurity risk and unauthorized cyber activity; and (3) mitigation strategies to prevent, deter, and protect against cybersecurity risks.

DHS may include private sector cybersecurity specialists on such teams, and must continually assess and evaluate the teams and their operations and report specified metrics to Congress.

No additional funds are authorized to carry out this bill.</summary>
