  <summary date="2018-06-02T03:59:58Z" status="Public Law">(Sec. 1) This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to assist a veteran with a service-connected disability who is in the vocational rehabilitation and employment program to acquire necessary residential adaptations. Such assistance may not be provided if it would result in a duplication of benefits.

The aggregate amount of assistance available to a veteran may not exceed $77,307. The VA may waive this limitation if necessary for a veteran's rehabilitation program. The VA shall: (1) increase assistance limits annually, and (2) beginning on October 1, 2019, submit a biennial report on the use of such waiver authority.

The VA is not required to provide mortgage life insurance to an individual under the age of 70 with a service-connected disability who receives adaptive residential assistance under this bill.</summary>
