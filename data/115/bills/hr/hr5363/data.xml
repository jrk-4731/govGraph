  <summary date="2018-03-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Crime Victims Fund Preservation Act of 2018

This bill prohibits the receipts and disbursements of the Crime Victims Fund from being counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of: (1) the budget of the U.S. government, as submitted by the President; or (2) the congressional budget.

The bill establishes a point of order against considering legislation in the House or the Senate that authorizes the use of, or appropriates, amounts in the Crime Victims Fund for any purpose other than a purpose authorized by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. In the Senate, the point of order may be waived or suspended only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes).

The bill also exempts the Crime Victims Fund from sequestration. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)</summary>
