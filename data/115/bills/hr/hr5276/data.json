The bill expands food security assistance authorities.\n\nThe bill recognizes that American farmers play an integral role in U.S. food assistance and agricultural development programs overseas.\n\nAssistance shall be directed toward areas of greatest need, coordinated with indigenous organizations and beneficiary groups.\n\nThe bill extends authorities under the Act for (1) prepositioning agricultural commodities, (2) the micronutrient fortification program, and (3) the farmer-to-farmer training program.\n\nIt removes provisions setting minimum levels for purchase of U.S. agricultural commodities and for nonemergency assistance."
