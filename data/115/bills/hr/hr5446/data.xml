  <summary date="2018-04-17T12:39:34Z" status="Passed House amended">(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit the authority of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to immediately sell certain seized property. The IRS may continue to immediately sell seized property that is liable to perish (e.g., food, but not clothing or equipment) after the owner is given an opportunity to pay the appraised value of the property or post a bond to ensure payment. The IRS may no longer immediately sell seized property merely if it is liable to become greatly reduced in price or value or cannot be kept without great expense.</summary>
