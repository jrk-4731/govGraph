This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to award grants or enter into contracts to create or expand medical residency training programs in states where there are fewer than 30 medical residents per 100,000 people.

An awardee of a grant or contract provides a lower ratio of matching funds if its residency training program is in the field of primary care.</summary>
