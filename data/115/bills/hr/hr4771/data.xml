(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) to&#160;revise&#160;its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement on Assessment&#160;of Financial and Managerial Factors (which allows smaller bank companies to have higher debt levels than are generally allowed). Specifically, the FRB must raise the consolidated asset threshold at which the statement applies from $1 billion to $3 billion.</summary>
