    "text": "End Drunk Driving Act of 2017\u00a0\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Transportation to issue a final rule prescribing or amending a federal motor vehicle safety standard that would prevent operation of a motor vehicle when the operator is under the influence of alcohol.\n\nSuch standard shall:\n\n prevent the operation of the motor vehicle if the operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit; and require the technology to be reliable and accurate, set at the legal limit, unobtrusive and fast, tamper-proof/circumvention-resistent, functionary in extreme environments, and easily maintained. To meet grant requirements, a state must enact and enforce a law that requires the installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence.\n\nThe bill prescribes compliance requirements and penalties for noncompliance."
