This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to make an individual eligible to apply for a loan under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program if that individual: (1) is carrying at least three credit hours or the equivalent coursework for the course of study the individual is pursuing, (2) is enrolled in an educational program leading to a degree or certificate, and (3) was employed on a full-time basis for at least 10 years.

It makes those students eligible for interest subsidies. It requires the repayment period for such a loan to begin the day after six months after the student ceases to meet the loan eligibility requirements.</summary>
