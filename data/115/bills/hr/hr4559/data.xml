(Sec. 3) This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to conduct a global aviation security review to address improving aviation security standards, including standards intended to mitigate cybersecurity threats, across the global aviation system.

The security review shall establish best practices regarding:

 collaborating with foreign partners to improve global aviation security capabilities and standards; identifying foreign partners that have not successfully implemented security protocols from the International Civil Aviation Organization or the Department of Homeland Security and have not taken steps to implement such protocols; improving the development, outreach, and implementation process for security directives or emergency amendments issued to domestic and foreign air carriers; and assessing the cybersecurity and cyber espionage risk of security screening equipment. (Sec. 4) The TSA shall report to Congress: (1) within 90 days after enactment of this bill, on the organization, development, and progress of the security review; and (2) within 240 days after enactment, on best practices identified by the review and TSA actions to implement such practices.</summary>
