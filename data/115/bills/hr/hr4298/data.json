The Department of Agriculture may not make cost sharing payments for grazing undertaken pursuant to this bill.\n\n(CRP provides payments to farmers who agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality. Farmers with certain CRP contracts are required to apply authorized mid-contract management practices to CRP land to implement the conservation plan.)"
