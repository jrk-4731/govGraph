The bill modifies several federal programs and requirements to\n\n specify minimum federal acquisition requirements for natural gas and alternative fuel vehicles; authorize the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct specified research, development, and demonstration activities regarding natural gas vehicles; authorize DOE to award natural gas vehicle deployment grants under the Clean Cities program; and require specified funds provided for under certain settlement agreements for alleged violations of environmental laws to be used for alternative fuel vehicle deployment grants."
