This bill establishes alternative protocols and sanctions for inadvertent technical noncompliance with the Stark Rule against self-referral under Medicare. "Technical noncompliance" means, with respect to a compensation arrangement, that: (1) the agreement is not signed by one or more parties to the arrangement, (2) the arrangement was a holdover arrangement for a period longer than is allowed by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or (3) documentation of the arrangement&#160;contains specified identifying information&#160;but is otherwise insufficient to satisfy the writing requirement of an applicable exception.</summary>
