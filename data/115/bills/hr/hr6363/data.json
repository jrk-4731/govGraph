It also establishes a grant program to carry out an outreach campaign to provide: (1) access to legal resources, including free or low-cost legal resources for low-income individuals; (2) workshops educating the public on immigration consumer fraud; and (3) translation services. Grant recipients may not disclose or use personally identifiable information provided by individuals participating in outreach campaigns.\n\nThe bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to impose and enforce requirements on immigration consultants relating to advertising of immigration services, contracts for such services, and the retention and disposal of client documents. Immigration consultants must disclose in advertising materials and contracts that they are not immigration attorneys and may not represent aliens before an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals."
