Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Specifically, the bill repeals ED's authority to charge an origination fee on a direct loan first disbursed, or, in the case of a direct consolidation loan, for which an application is received, on or after July 1, 2017. (Origination fees are the fees lenders charge for processing new loan applications.)"
