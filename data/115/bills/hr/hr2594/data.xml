  <summary date="2017-05-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Payment for Performance Act of 2017

This bill amends the Small Business Act to allow a small business performing a construction contract awarded by a federal agency to submit a request for an equitable adjustment to the agency's contracting officer if such officer directs a change in the terms of the contract performance without the agreement of the small business.

The agency must provide to the small business an interim partial payment of at least 50% of the estimated amount required to cover additional costs resulting from such change. Such small business shall pay to a first tier subcontractor or supplier the portion of such payment that is attributable to the increased costs of performance incurred by such subcontractor or supplier due to such change.</summary>
