The CMS may make grants to eligible entities for:\n\n the development of new state and regional maternity and infant care quality collaboratives, expanded activities of existing collaboratives, and maternity and infant care initiatives within established state and regional quality collaboratives that are not focused exclusively on maternity care. Under current law, the CMS must contract with a consensus-based entity to carry out specified duties regarding performance measurement. The bill requires such an entity to facilitate increased coordination and alignment between the public and private sector with respect to quality and efficiency measures."
