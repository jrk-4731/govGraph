The IRS must develop and implement:\n\n online accounts to provide services to taxpayers and return preparers, a process for accepting electronic tax forms and supporting documents, an Internet platform for Form 1099 filings, a fully automated program for disclosing taxpayer information for third-party income verification using the Internet, and uniform standards and procedures for the acceptance of electronic signatures. The bill also:\n\n establishes the position of IRS Chief Information Officer; limits redisclosures and uses of tax return information by individuals designated by taxpayers to receive the information; allows the IRS to require additional taxpayers to file returns electronically; and allows the IRS to pay fees for the use of credit, debit, or charge cards for tax payments if the fees are recouped by charging taxpayers."
