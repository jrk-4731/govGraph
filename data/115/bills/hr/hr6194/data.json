The Government Accountability Office must conduct biennial audits of the GSA National Broker Contract and a review of the application of certain enhanced competition requirements.\n\nThe GSA must sell or exchange part of the Department of Energy (DOE) Forrestal complex to fund the construction of a new DOE headquarters.\n\nIn addition, the bill allows\u00a0the Department of Homeland Security to authorize and train security personnel contracted to protect certain federal buildings\u00a0or grounds\u00a0to carry firearms and, under specified circumstances,\u00a0detain individuals without a warrant."
