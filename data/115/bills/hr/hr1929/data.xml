This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to increase the amount of coverage available under the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Increased Cost of Compliance program. The program insures the cost of mitigating future flood damage to an NFIP-insured structure that has been substantially or repetitively damaged by floods.</summary>
