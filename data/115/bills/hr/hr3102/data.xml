  <summary date="2017-06-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish an Office of Service Member Naturalization to: (1) identify members of the uniformed services who are not citizens and inform them of the availability of naturalization assistance; (2) help such members complete the naturalization process before their separation from the uniformed services; and (3) coordinate points-of-contact at military installations to ensure that personnel who are responsible for assisting members through the naturalization process successfully complete their assignments.

DOD shall ensure that each Military Entrance Processing Station provides the Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, and Form N-426, Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service, to new recruits for the uniformed services who are processed at a military entrance processing command center and are not U.S. citizens.</summary>
