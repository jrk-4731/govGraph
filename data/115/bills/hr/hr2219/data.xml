(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to add the Secretary of the Treasury as a member of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. The task force must submit to Congress recommendations&#160;for the revision of&#160;anti-money laundering programs specifically targeting severe forms of human trafficking.

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&#160;must: (1) review and enhance training and procedures to improve the capability of specified programs to target financial transactions relating to severe forms of human trafficking, (2) review and enhance procedures for referring potential severe human trafficking cases to the appropriate law enforcement agency, and (3) determine&#160;whether&#160;financial institution requirements are sufficient to detect and deter money laundering related to&#160;severe forms of human trafficking.

(Sec. 3) The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence must coordinate with other specified agencies to combat the illicit financing relating to severe forms of human trafficking.

(Sec. 4) The bill amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to require the task force to report on efforts to eliminate money laundering related to severe forms of human trafficking.

(Sec. 5) The bill provides additional criteria to be considered by the State Department to indicate a country's serious and sustained efforts to eliminate human trafficking. Specifically, the bill adds criteria regarding whether a country has taken or is taking steps to implement a framework for preventing financial transactions involving severe forms of human trafficking.</summary>
