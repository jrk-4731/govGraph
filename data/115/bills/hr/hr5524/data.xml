  <summary date="2018-04-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill limits the authority of the Department of State with respect to international postal agreements that would require the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to establish a classification, rate, or fee for any postal service.

The Board of Governors of the USPS must establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail and reasonable and equitable rates of postage and fees for the transportation and delivery within the United States of documents and goods received from other countries. Such classifications, rates, and fees shall be regulated by the Postal Regulatory Commission in the same manner as comparable domestic classifications, rates, and fees, and shall be available to users of domestic postal services under the same terms and conditions as provided to foreign post offices and other entities tendering documents and goods from other countries to the USPS.

 The classifications, rates, and fees established by the USPS shall not discriminate between documents or goods received from other countries based on the country of origin, the nationality of the sender, or the ownership or governmental designation of the entity tendering the documents or goods to it.

The State Department may not conclude a treaty, convention, or other intergovernmental agreement that requires the USPS to provide preferential classifications, rates, or fees for the transportation and delivery within the United States of documents and goods received from other countries unless specified conditions are met.</summary>
