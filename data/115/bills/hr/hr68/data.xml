 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to revise and reauthorize for FY2020 the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program.

It subjects JABG grants to accountability measures. The Office of Inspector General in the Department of Justice (DOJ) must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients. DOJ must submit an annual certification to Congress and identify and report on duplicative grant awards.

(Sec. 3) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the use of best practices is encouraged for activities carried out with JABG funds.

(Sec. 4) It amends the Justice Assistance Act of 1984 to eliminate existing authority for DOJ to award grants under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Program through FY2023.</summary>
