A \"surface transportation asset\" includes facilities, equipment, or systems used to provide transportation services by: (1) a public transportation agency, (2) a railroad carrier, (3) an owner or operator of bus services or a bus terminal, or (4) other facilities as determined by DHS.\n\n Officers and intelligence analysts assigned to locations with participating state, local, and regional fusion centers shall participate in the generation and dissemination of transportation security intelligence products, with an emphasis on terrorist and other threats to surface transportation assets that: (1) assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies in deploying their resources; (2) promote more consistent and timely sharing of threat information among jurisdictions; and (3) enhance DHS's situational awareness of such terrorist and other threats.\n\n(Sec. 4) The TSA shall: (1) make available to public and private sector stakeholders a framework for establishing an integrated and unified operations center responsible for overseeing daily operations of a transportation facility that promotes coordination for responses to terrorism, serious incidents, and other purposes; and (2) report to the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on operations centers at transportation facilities at which the TSA has a presence.\n\n(Sec. 5) DHS, may develop, through the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, a training program to enhance the protection, preparedness, and response capabilities of law enforcement agencies with respect to terrorism and other serious incidents at a surface transportation asset."
