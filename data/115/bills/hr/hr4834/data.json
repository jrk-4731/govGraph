A fleet is a group of 20 or more light-duty motor vehicles, medium-duty motor vehicles, or heavy-duty motor vehicles carrying 14 or more passengers operating primarily in a metropolitan area with a population of more than 250,000 that are: (1) centrally dispatched; or (2) centrally fueled, or capable of being centrally fueled, and controlled by a governmental entity or other person meeting specified criteria. The bill excludes certain motor vehicles from the term \"fleet,\" including vehicles rented to the general public, law enforcement vehicles, and emergency vehicles."
