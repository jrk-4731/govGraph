 This bill recognizes the authority of states or local governments to require fleet owners or operators to acquire only new fleet vehicles that are alternative fuel or high-efficiency motor vehicles that:

 operate on natural gas, hydrogen, or biodiesel; are flexible fuel vehicles that operate on gasoline, E85, and M85; are plug-in electric drive vehicles; are propelled solely by a fuel cell that produces power without the use of petroleum or a petroleum-based fuel; are propelled solely by something other than an internal combustion engine and produce power without the use of petroleum or a petroleum-based fuel; or meet a technology or performance-based characteristic that is commercially available. A fleet is a group of 20 or more light-duty motor vehicles, medium-duty motor vehicles, or heavy-duty motor vehicles carrying 14 or more passengers operating primarily in a metropolitan area with a population of more than 250,000 that are: (1) centrally dispatched; or (2) centrally fueled, or capable of being centrally fueled, and controlled by a governmental entity or other person meeting specified criteria. The bill excludes certain motor vehicles from the term "fleet," including vehicles rented to the general public, law enforcement vehicles, and emergency vehicles.</summary>
