This bill amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Director of Refugee Educational Assistance (to be designated by USAID), to provide long-term assistance to expand and improve primary and secondary education for displaced children from areas of conflict.

Such assistance shall be used to: (1) build the capacity for private sector and civil society organizations to develop and strengthen primary and secondary curricula, coordinate with host country educational facilities, and strengthen technical capacities; (2) establish and expand U.S.-host country educational partnerships; and (3) assist efforts to educate women and girls.

 The director shall seek to use funding appropriated for the purposes of this bill to leverage private sector funding for such purposes and shall prioritize efforts to identify such sources of such private sector funding.</summary>
