The CMS shall select supplier and provider types that will be required to participate in the pilot program as a condition of Medicare payment, but\u00a0must exempt from participation a supplier or provider that: (1) does not have access to card-reader technology, (2) does not have sufficient internet access, or (3) has a low volume of Medicare claims. The CMS shall select a private contractor to implement and operate the pilot program.\n\nThe CMS must submit specified reports to Congress on program design, implementation, and performance.\n\nFor purposes of conducting the pilot program, the CMS shall\u00a0provide for the\u00a0transfer of $150 million from the Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund to the CMS Program Management Account."
