After determining that such a risk exists, DHS may limit the disclosure of information relating to the basis for restricting a procurement and may exclude a vendor from the procurement process. The bill requires DHS to make certain security-related determinations and provide notifications before it can exercise the authority to restrict procurement of any covered article.\n\nThe bill defines \"supply chain risk\" as the risk that a malicious actor may sabotage, maliciously introduce an unwanted function, extract or modify data, or otherwise manipulate the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of a covered article."
