This bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an audit of two specified caregiver programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Such audit shall include: (1) a review of the budget formulations, execution, allocation, and use of funds; and (2) recommendations for streamlining and consolidation.

Within three months of the completion of such audit, VA must submit a report to Congress on:

 recommendations the VA is able to implement without legislative changes; legislative changes recommended by the GAO; recommendations that VA determines are problematic, overly expensive, or impractical; and alternative approaches to address the problem. Within 24 months of submitting such report, VA shall:

 implement the recommendations the VA is able to implement without legislative changes, establish national policies that are designed to streamline and consolidate the programs, and establish a database to monitor all VA programs that provide assistance to caregivers and all caregivers who receive such assistance.</summary>
