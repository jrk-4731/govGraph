Such audit shall include: (1) a review of the budget formulations, execution, allocation, and use of funds; and (2) recommendations for streamlining and consolidation.\n\nWithin three months of the completion of such audit, VA must submit a report to Congress on:\n\n recommendations the VA is able to implement without legislative changes; legislative changes recommended by the GAO; recommendations that VA determines are problematic, overly expensive, or impractical; and alternative approaches to address the problem. Within 24 months of submitting such report, VA shall:\n\n implement the recommendations the VA is able to implement without legislative changes, establish national policies that are designed to streamline and consolidate the programs, and establish a database to monitor all VA programs that provide assistance to caregivers and all caregivers who receive such assistance."
