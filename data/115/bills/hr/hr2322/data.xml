  <summary date="2017-05-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights

 This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that an Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights is printed on signage in accessible formats and displayed prominently and conspicuously in each VA prosthetics and orthotics clinic. VA employees who work at such clinics, as well as patient advocates of veterans who receive care there, must receive training on such Bill of Rights. The VA shall conduct outreach to inform veterans of such Bill of Rights.

Such Bill of Rights shall include the right to: (1) access the highest quality prosthetic and orthotic care; (2) select the practitioner that best meets their prosthetic and orthotic needs; (3) receive timely and efficient prosthetic and orthotic care; and (4) transition and readjust to civilian life in an honorable manner, including by having ample access to vocational rehabilitation, employment programs, and housing assistance.

The bill directs: (1) the VA to collect information relating to the alleged mistreatment of injured and amputee veterans, (2) the veteran liaison at each VA medical center to submit quarterly to the VA's Chief Consultant of Prosthetics and Sensory Aids a report on such information, and (3) the Chief Consultant to investigate and address such information.</summary>
