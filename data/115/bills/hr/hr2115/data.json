It establishes minimum standards with respect to notifying the next of kin or designated emergency contact following an individual's death or life-threatening emergency while in custody.\n\nThe Department of Justice must reduce by 10% the allocation of funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program for a state or local government that fails to comply.\n\nThe bill also amends the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 to require a state or federal law enforcement agency to include, in its quarterly report on deaths in custody, additional information such as the date and time that death notification was provided and the date and time of each unsuccessful notification attempt."
