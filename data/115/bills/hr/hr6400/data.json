In compiling such analysis, CBP shall consider and examine: (1) personnel needs, including K-9 units, and estimated costs, at each port of entry; (2) technology needs, including radiation portal monitors and non-intrustive inspection technology, and estimated costs at each port of entry; and (3) infrastructure needs and estimated costs at each port of entry.\n\nCBP shall, at specified intervals, provide to the committees a ports of entry strategy and implementation plan."
