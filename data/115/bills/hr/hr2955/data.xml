This bill allows a passenger car, multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, or bus to be equipped with a pulsating light system for high mounted stop lamps.

The term "pulsating light system" means a system for a high mounted stop lamp in which: (1) the lamp pulses rapidly no more than four times and for no more than two seconds when the vehicle brake is applied and then converts to a continuous light until the brake is released, and (2) the rapid pulsing may not be repeated upon a subsequent application of the brakes for a lock-out period of five seconds after the brake's release.</summary>
