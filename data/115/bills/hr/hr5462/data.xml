This bill reauthorizes and modifies the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Margin Protection Program for dairy producers, which is a voluntary program that pays participating dairy operations when a formula-based national margin (the difference between milk prices and feed costs) falls below a producer-selected insured margin.

The bill changes the name of the program to the Dairy Risk Management Program and modifies coverage levels and premiums.

With respect to other USDA dairy programs, the bill:

 reauthorizes the Dairy Forward Pricing Program, reauthorizes the Dairy Indemnity Program, reauthorizes the Dairy Promotion and Research Program, and repeals the Dairy Product Donation Program.</summary>
