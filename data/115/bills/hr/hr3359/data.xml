(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to redesignate the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) National Protection and Programs Directorate as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It transfers resources and responsibilities of the directorate to the agency.

The agency shall be headed by the Director of National Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security. Its responsibilities shall include: leading cybersecurity and critical infrastructure security programs, operations, and associated policy; and carrying out DHS's responsibilities concerning chemical facility antiterrorism standards.

The bill details the organizational structure of the agency.

(Sec. 3) The bill transfers within DHS the Office of Biometric Identity Management to the Management Directorate.

It also requires DHS to transfer the Federal Protective Service to an appropriate DHS component, directorate, or office following the completion of an ongoing Government Accountability Office review.

(Sec. 4) DHS shall report on its leadership role in cloud-based cybersecurity deployments for civilian federal departments and agencies.</summary>
