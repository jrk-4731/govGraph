In addition to meeting other specified requirements, each PDMP must allow health care providers to access the number and type of controlled substances prescribed to a Medicaid enrollee during the most recent 12-month period.\n\nThe bill also temporarily increases the federal matching rate with respect to\u00a0Medicaid expenditures related to\u00a0PDMP implementation for states that have agreements to promote PDMP interoperability with their neighboring states.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must publish guidance and best practices for states regarding PDMP utilization. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must report on PDMP administration."
