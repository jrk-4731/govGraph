(The program provides grants for programs to provide agricultural education and assistance directed at accommodating disability in farm operations for disabled individuals and family members engaged in farming and farm-related occupations.)\n\nThe bill modifies the program to specify that veterans are eligible for assistance under the program, including disabled veterans and family members who: (1) are engaged in farming and farm-related occupations, and (2) are pursuing new farming opportunities.\n\nThe bill also permits the grants to be used for programs that provide behavioral therapy programs to assist veterans with mental service-connected disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder."
