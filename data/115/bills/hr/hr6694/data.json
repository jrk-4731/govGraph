The expenses must be for full-time employees whose compensation does not exceed $82,000 for the year.\n\nA \"high-demand occupation training expense\" is designed to lead to employment in an occupation that is expected to experience not fewer than 20% occupational openings over a specified 10-year period. A \"low-demand occupation training expense\" is designed to lead to employment in any other occupation."
