  <summary date="2017-10-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Disaster Relief Act of 2017

This bill amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to exceed the $100,000 limit on small business development center assistance grants to accommodate extraordinary occurrences having a catastrophic impact on small business concerns in a community.

The bill amends the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 to permit: (1) the use of SBA and Farm Service Agency (formerly, Farmers Home Administration) loans for enterprises that are vital to recovery efforts in a disaster area (including debris removal services, manufactured housing, gasoline, telecommunications, or building materials); and (2) such loans to waive any required evaluation of creditworthiness in exchange for a fee set by the SBA or the Farm Service Agency.</summary>
