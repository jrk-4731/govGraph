  <summary date="2017-10-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish a three-year demonstration program to determine the impact of third-party, interest-free payment arrangements on: (1)&#160;health outcomes, (2)&#160;patient engagement and satisfaction, and (3) claims for bad debt that are attributable to a hospital's inability to collect&#160;deductibles and coinsurance&#160;for Medicare hospital services.&#160;Under the program, the CMS&#160;shall&#160;provide a payment incentive to a hospital that participates in such a payment&#160;arrangement and demonstrates improvement in those three areas.</summary>
