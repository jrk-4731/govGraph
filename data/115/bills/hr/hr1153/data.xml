Mortgage Choice Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to specify that&#160;neither escrow charges for insurance nor affiliated title charges shall&#160;be considered "points and fees" for purposes of determining whether a mortgage is a "high-cost mortgage." (A high-cost mortgage designation restricts the terms of the loan and requires a lender to make certain disclosures to the borrower.)</summary>
