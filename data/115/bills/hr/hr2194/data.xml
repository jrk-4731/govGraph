  <summary date="2017-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Cigarette Smoking Reduction and Electronic Vapor Alternatives Act of 2017

This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to authorize the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate electronic cigarettes&#160;through regulation of e-liquids (solutions used in electronic&#160;cigarettes)&#160;and personal electronic vaporizers (products that&#160;convert e-liquids into inhalable vapor).

E-liquids and personal electronic vaporizers are excluded from the definition of tobacco products.

The bill sets forth requirements for the sale and manufacturing of e-liquids and personal electronic vaporizers including: (1) prohibiting sales to persons younger than 18, (2) establishing manufacturing standards, and (3) requiring certification of compliance with manufacturing standards.

The FDA may prohibit advertising of e-liquids and vaporizers to minors. The Office of E-Liquid and Personal Vaporizer Standards Compliance is created in the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products and&#160;Tobacco Harm Reduction.

State and local laws on e-liquids and personal electronic vaporizers are preempted by this bill.

The FDA shall provide Congress&#160;a comparative health risk assessment of tobacco products and other nicotine delivery alternatives and rank them based on morbidity and mortality risk as compared to smoking cigarettes.</summary>
