This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to: (1)&#160;eliminate the standards, assessments, and academic accountability requirements for state and local educational agencies that receive funds under the Act for the education of disadvantaged children, (2) require such funds to be allocated based on the number of children residing in each state who are living in poverty, and (3) allow educational agencies to distribute per pupil amounts from such funds to parents for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses.

The bill prohibits federal officers or employees from mandating academic standards, assessments, curricula, or accountability systems.</summary>
