For aliens not employed as temporary or seasonal workers, the maximum initial period is 36 months with subsequent periods of 18 months.\n\nA trust fund is established to provide a monetary incentive for H-2C workers to return to their countries of origin upon expiration of their visas.\n\nThe bill establishes annual fiscal year H-2C admission limits.\n\nThe bill also sets forth provisions regarding: (1) penalties for failure to pay wages or required benefits, (2) working conditions and wages, (3) admissions and extensions of stay, (4) abandonment of employment and worker replacement, (5) protection of U.S. workers, and (6) arbitration and mediation of employment-related claims of H-2C workers."
