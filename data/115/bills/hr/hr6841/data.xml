 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for a specified portion of the cost of commercial and residential buildings&#160;that comply with resilient construction requirements in a federally-declared major disaster area.

The bill defines "resilient construction requirements" as&#160;requirements that such&#160;buildings are designed and constructed to: (1) resist hazards brought&#160;on by a major disaster; (2) continue to provide their primary functions after a major disaster; (3) reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruptive event; and (4)&#160;have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event.

The credit does not apply to property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after December 31, 2022.</summary>
