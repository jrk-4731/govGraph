This bill denies immigration benefits to aliens determined to be criminal gang members, criminal street gang members, or gang supporters. No such alien may file an immigration petition, affidavit of support, or be permitted to assume custodial care of an unaccompanied alien minor.

The bill, absent countervailing evidence, revokes the citizenship of an individual who:

 was naturalized after December 24, 1952, and within 10 years after naturalization becomes a member of a criminal gang or other organization in which membership at the time of naturalization would have prohibited such individual's naturalization.</summary>
