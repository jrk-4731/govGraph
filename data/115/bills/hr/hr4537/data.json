(Sec. 7) The bill amends the Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010 to modify requirements for an international agreement entered into by the Department of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office. Such an agreement must only apply on a prospective basis. In developing an agreement, the parties must coordinate with state insurance regulators. Congress has the power to review and disapprove by joint resolution any agreement."
