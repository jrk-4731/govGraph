  <summary date="2017-03-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Electronic Message Preservation Act of 2017

 This bill requires the Archivist of the United States to promulgate regulations governing federal agency preservation of electronic messages that are federal records and to periodically review and amend, as necessary, such regulations. Such regulations, at a minimum, must: (1) require the electronic capture, management, and preservation of such electronic records in accordance with the Federal Records Act; (2) require such records to be retrievable through electronic searches; and (3) include timelines for federal agency implementation of the regulations that ensure compliance as expeditiously as practicable.

The Archivist must promulgate regulations that: (1) establish mandatory minimum functional requirements for electronic records management systems and a process to ensure that such systems meet the functional requirements; and (2) include requirements for the capture, management, and preservation of other electronic records. "Electronic records management system" means software designed to manage electronic records.

Federal agencies must report to the Archivist on agency compliance with the regulations and make such reports publicly available on the agency's website.

The Archivist must: (1) establish standards for the management of electronic presidential records during a President's term of office, including records management controls necessary for the capture, management, and preservation of electronic messages and for ensuring that electronic messages are readily accessible for retrieval through electronic searches; (2) certify annually whether electronic records management controls established by a President meet the requirements of the Presidential Records Act; and (3) report annually on the status of such certification.

The Archivist shall report to Congress one year after the conclusion of a President's term of office on: (1) the volume and format of electronic presidential records deposited into the presidential archival depository, and (2) whether electronic records management controls of a President met the requirements of this bill and the Presidential Records Act.</summary>
