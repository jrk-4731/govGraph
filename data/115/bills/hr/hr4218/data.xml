This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise the definition of "official act" for purposes of an offense involving bribery of public officials.

Currently, an official act is any decision or action on a question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before a public official, in their official capacity. This bill specifies that an official act includes any action taken or to be taken under color of official authority by a public official or person who has been selected to be a public official.</summary>
