The bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations.\n\nTreasury must prohibit a U.S.-based financial institution from knowingly engaging in a significant transaction with a covered person. The bill establishes civil penalties for violations.\n\n(Sec. 4) The bill amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the United States to oppose international financial assistance for a foreign government that does not implement these sanctions against North Korea. The President may waive this directive after specified steps are taken.\n\nThe bill amends the Export-Import Bank Act to prohibit the bank from providing support to a covered person.\n\n(Sec. 5) Treasury must report on compliance with this bill among financial institutions, including any penalties imposed and efforts by Treasury to support compliance.\n\nThe bill amends the International Financial Institutions Act to require Treasury to: (1) instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the use of the IMF's administrative budget for technical assistance that strengthens the capacity of IMF members to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and (2) report on the effectiveness of such assistance.\n\n(Sec. 6) The President may suspend or terminate sanctions under this bill if certain steps regarding nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are taken by North Korea."
