  <summary date="2018-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Whole Farm Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 2018 

This bill modifies requirements for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) crop insurance policy, which covers all commodities on a farm under a single policy.

The bill requires USDA to:

 expand coverage for beginning farmers under the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program to allow the farmers to develop the revenue history necessary to qualify for WFRP; allow insurance providers to use alternative compensation structures based on the time necessary to write and administer the plans; ensure that that all producers, including producers with expected revenue from an operation that is greater than 35% of the revenue for the previous year, are able to obtain coverage; and reduce paperwork requirements for the program.</summary>
