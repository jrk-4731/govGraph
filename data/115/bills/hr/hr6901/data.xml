This bill reorganizes Office of Management and Budget (OMB) information technology (IT) activities and establishes new IT reporting requirements.

The bill renames (1) the Office of E-Government &amp; Information Technology (E-Gov) as the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (Federal CIO), and (2) the E-Government Fund as the Federal IT Fund. The office shall be headed by a Federal Chief Information Officer who shall report directly to the Director of OMB (currently, the head of E-Gov reports to the Deputy Director). There is established in the office a Federal Chief Information Security Officer.

Agencies must report IT expenditures to the Federal CIO. The Federal CIO must publish timely, searchable, computer-readable data on agency IT expenditures, projects, and programs.

The Federal CIO shall submit to Congress a proposal for consolidating IT across the federal government and increasing the use of shared services.</summary>
