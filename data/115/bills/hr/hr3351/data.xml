This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for up to 8,000 employment-based immigrant visas per fiscal year for qualifying nurses, physical therapists, and other health care workers (excluding physicians) and their accompanying family members. Such aliens are exempted from worldwide and foreign state numerical limits.

A petition filed on behalf of such an immigrant must be accompanied by evidence that the prospective U.S. employer has the ability to pay the proffered wage.</summary>
