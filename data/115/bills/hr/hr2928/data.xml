  <summary date="2017-06-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Transportation to modify federal consumer disclosure regulations to ensure that a reporting carrier: (1) discloses, upon the reasonable request of a consumer during the course of a reservation or ticketing discussion, the projected period between the actual wheels-off and wheels-on times for a reportable flight; and (2) displays on its public website information on such times for the most recent calendar month for a reportable flight.

A "reporting carrier" is an air carrier that accounts for at least 1% of domestic scheduled-passenger revenues in the most recently reported 12-month period.

A "reportable flight" is a nonstop flight to or from any airport within the 48 states that accounts for 1% of domestic scheduled-passenger enplanements in the previous calendar year.</summary>
