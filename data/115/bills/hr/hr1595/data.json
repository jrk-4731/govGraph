    "text": "Mutual Bank Capital Opportunity Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to allow mutual capital certificates issued by\u00a0a mutual depository\u00a0(i.e., a federally insured depository institution operating in a non-stock form)\u00a0to qualify as common-equity Tier 1 capital for purposes of\u00a0satisfying federal\u00a0capital requirements. A\u00a0\"mutual capital certificate\" is\u00a0a financial instrument that: (1) is subordinate to all claims against, and unsecured by the assets of,\u00a0the issuing mutual depository; (2) does not permit preemptive rights; (3) in general, does not provide voting or member rights; (4) is not eligible for use as collateral for any loan made\u00a0by the issuing mutual depository; (5)\u00a0entitles the holder to a payment of fixed, variable, or participating dividends (if the depository's board so declares); and (6)\u00a0is generally not redeemable until five years after issuance.\n\nThe appropriate federal banking agencies must jointly issue regulations to implement these provisions and to identify other financial instruments issued by mutual depositories that shall qualify as additional Tier 1 capital for purposes of federal capital requirements. The agencies must submit to Congress a series of reports on their progress in promulgating such regulations."
