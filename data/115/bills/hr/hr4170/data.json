DOJ must develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to improve FARA enforcement and administration. The DOJ Inspector General must review: (1) the development and implementation of a comprehensive strategy; and (2) the use, effectiveness, and potential abuse of DOJ's authority to issue civil investigative demands.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must analyze the effectiveness of FARA enforcement and administration."
