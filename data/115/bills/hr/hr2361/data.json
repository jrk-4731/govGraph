    "text": "Energy Savings and Building Efficiency Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to revise provisions regarding the technical assistance that the Department of Energy (DOE) provides to states, Indian tribes, local governments, or model building energy code-setting and standard development organizations (model organizations) with respect to building energy codes. DOE must provide technical assistance to implement technically feasible and cost-effective building energy codes.\n\nStates and Indian tribes must measure their compliance with applicable building energy codes or with the associated model building energy code. Standards for compliance are established.\n\nDOE may not promote or discourage the adoption of a particular building energy code, code provision, or energy savings target to a state or Indian tribe. Information provided by DOE is \"influential information\" subject to Office of Management and Budget guidelines.\n\nDOE may submit to the model organizations timely model building energy code amendment proposals after considering the economic feasibility of achieving the amendment proposals and the potential costs and savings for consumers and building owners by conducting a return on investment analysis using a simple payback methodology over a three, five, and seven years. (Simple payback is the time in years that is required for energy savings to exceed the incremental first cost of a new requirement or code.) DOE may not propose or provide assistance for any code or amendment that has a payback greater than 10 years.\n\nDOE must provide grants to establish building training and assessment centers at institutions of higher education.\n\nAny DOE program that may enable the owner of a building to obtain a rating, score, or label regarding energy usage or performance of a building must be made available on a voluntary basis."
