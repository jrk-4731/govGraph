The bill defines \"offending oil polluter\" as any person who is responsible for a vessel or facility from which oil or a hazardous substance is discharged and any person who is a member of the same expanded affiliated group as the offending oil polluter.\n\nSpecifically, the bill denies a deduction or a credit for any amount paid or incurred:\n\n in connection with a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance, for attorney fees and court costs in connection with any legal action involving such discharge, as a payment or restitution related to such discharge, and for costs or penalties certified in a settlement by a federal court or required by federal law or regulations. The Department of the Treasury must report to Congress regarding: (1) the revenue loss as a result of tax deductions allowed for cleaning up oil that is discharged after April 19, 2010, and (2) the amount of revenue savings resulting from this bill."
