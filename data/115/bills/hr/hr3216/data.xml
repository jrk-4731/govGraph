This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require registered securities issuers to disclose annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to shareholders: (1) the total number of employees domiciled in the United States and listed by number in each state (including those of consolidated subsidiaries); (2) the total number of such employees physically working in and domiciled in any country other than the United States, listed by number in each country; and (3) the percentage increase or decrease in such numbers from the previous reporting year.

Certain new public companies and issuers with total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year&#160;shall be&#160;exempt from&#160;these requirements.</summary>
