Currently, some committees are permanent and some have earlier termination dates.\n\nThe bill also repeals the provision that allows enlisted members of the Coast Guard who are discharged for bad conduct, undesirability, unsuitability, or inaptitude to be furnished civilian clothing at a cost not to exceed $30 per person."
