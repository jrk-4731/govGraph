(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to issue a final rule based on the provisions of a proposed rule regarding Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) by December 31, 2018.

PACE is a program under Medicare and Medicaid that provides in-home and community services for certain individuals as an alternative to nursing home care. The proposed rule updates and revises application, enforcement, and other administrative requirements. The CMS published the proposed rule in August 2016; final action is expected in August 2019.</summary>
