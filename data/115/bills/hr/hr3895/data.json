A \u201csmart city or community\u201d is one in which innovative, advanced, and trustworthy information, communication, and energy technologies are applied to: (1) improve the health and quality of life of residents; (2) increase efficiency of operations and services; (3) promote economic growth; and (4) improve safety, security, sustainability, resiliency, livability, and work life.\n\nThe Department of Commerce shall establish a regional demonstration grant program focused on facilitating adoption, and allowing measurement and validation of performance, of advanced smart city or community technologies and systems. Commerce shall also convene a working group to develop tools for evaluating the cybersecurity of smart city or community technologies.\n\nThe Department of Labor shall establish a pilot program to furnish competitive grants for technology-based job training and education programs that provide industry-recognized credentials.\n\nThe bill requires strong federal encouragement and support for private sector-led standards development activities.\n\nThe bill requires the establishment of a strategic international smart cities and communities trade program that includes trade missions to promote and assist smart-community activities, as by leveraging expertise in infrastructure development."
