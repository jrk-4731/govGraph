    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since the House agreed to the Senate amendment without amendment on December 20, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. It also establishes an oil and gas leasing program for the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska.\n\n(Unless otherwise specified, provisions referred to in this summary as temporary or as a suspension of an existing provision apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.)\n\nTITLE I\n\nSubtitle A-- Individual Tax Reform\n\nPart I--Tax Rate Reform\n\n(Sec. 11001) This section temporarily replaces the existing tax brackets (10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%) with new brackets (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% , 37%) and specifies the income levels that apply for each bracket.\n\nThe bill also: (1) modifies the taxation of the unearned income of children, and (2) requires the Department of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as a head of household.\n\n(Sec. 11002) This section requires the chained Consumer Price Index to be used to index the brackets for inflation.\n\nPart II--Deduction For Qualified Business Income Of Pass-Thru Entities\n\n(Sec. 11011) This section temporarily allows an individual taxpayer to deduct 20% of qualified business income (i.e., business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship which is currently taxed using individual income tax rates), including aggregate qualified Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) dividends, qualified cooperative dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income.\n\nThe bill specifies formulas for determining the taxpayer's deduction for qualified business income and for determining the deduction for certain agricultural or horticultural cooperatives.\n\nThe deduction applies to taxable income, is not used to calculate adjusted gross income (AGI), and is available to taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. Trusts and estates are eligible for the deduction.\n\nThe bill phases in a limitation for the deduction when wages exceed $157,500 ($315,000 in the case of a joint return). The bill also phases in a disallowance of the deduction when taxable income with respect to specified service trades or businesses exceeds the limits. The limits are fully phased in when taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts by $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns).\n\nA \"specified service trade or business\" is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment management trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or commodities. The term excludes engineering and architecture services.\n\n(Sec. 11012) This section temporarily prohibits taxpayers other than corporations from claiming excess business losses.\n\nAn excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or businesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus $250,000 (200% of the amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation after 2018.\n\nIn the case of a partnership or S corporation, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level.

(Under the top corporate rate of 21% that takes effect in 2018, the proration percentage is 25%.)\n\n(Under the proration rules, in calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property or casualty insurance company must reduce the amount of the losses incurred by a specified percentage of: (1) the insurer's tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received, and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts the company owns.)\n\n(Sec. 13516) This section repeals the special estimated tax payment rules for insurance companies.\n\n(Sec. 13517) This section modifies the rules for computing life insurance tax reserves that are used in determining the taxable income of a life insurance company.\n\n(Sec. 13518) This section modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing dividends received deductions and reserve deductions with respect to untaxed income.

It also imposes reporting requirements on the payor in the case of the payment of reportable death benefits.\n\nA \"reportable policy sale\" is the acquisition of an interest in a life insurance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured apart from the acquirer's interest in such life insurance contract.\n\n(Sec. 13521) This section sets forth requirements for the determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract.

Actuarial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant's age at the time of the calculation.\n\n(Sec. 13613) This section extends the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution. A \"qualified plan loan offset amount\" is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the severance from employment of the participant.\n\nPart VIII--Exempt Organizations\n\n(Sec. 13701) This section imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities.\n\n(Sec. 13702) This section requires tax-exempt organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business to calculate unrelated business taxable income separately with respect to each trade or business and without regard to a specified deduction that applies for certain unrelated business taxable income.\n\n(Sec. 13703) This section includes in unrelated business taxable income of a tax-exempt organization any expenses paid or incurred by the organization for certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed under section 274 of the IRC, including qualified transportation fringe benefits, a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking, or any on-premises athletic facility.\n\n(Sec. 13704) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to prohibit a charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights.\n\n(Sec. 13705) This section modifies the deduction for charitable contributions to repeal the exception to substantiation requirements for certain contributions reported by the donee organization.\n\nPart IX--Other Provisions\n\nSubpart A--Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform\n\n(Sec. 13801) This section excludes the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for purposes of the uniform interest capitalization rules, which allows the producers to deduct interest expenses attributable to a shorter production period.

The bill also allows importers of wine produced outside of the United States to assign the credit to the foreign producer, subject to specified requirements.\n\n(Sec. 13805) The section modifies the alcohol-by-volume levels of the first two tiers of the excise tax on wine, by changing 14% to 16%. Under the provision, a wine producer or importer may produce or import still wine that has an alcohol-by-volume level of up to 16% and remain subject to the lowest rate of $1.07 per wine gallon.\n\n(Sec. 13806) This section specifies definitions for \"mead\" and \"low alcohol by volume wine\" that are eligible to be taxed at the lowest applicable rate for still wine.\n\n(Sec. 13807) This section reduces the excise tax rate for certain distilled spirits in 2018 and 2019 to: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter.\n\nMembers of the same controlled group may not receive the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates.\n\n(Sec. 13808) This section allows distillers to transfer spirits in approved containers other than bulk containers in bond without payment of tax.

Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held.\n\nSubtitle D--International Tax Provisions\n\nUnder current law, the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations are not taxed until the income is repatriated (paid as dividends) into the United States. The corporations are allowed a tax credit against U.S. taxes for taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions.

It does not include a passive foreign investment company that is not a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).\n\nNo foreign tax credit or deduction is allowed for any taxes paid or accrued with respect to any dividend for which a deduction is allowed under this section.\n\nThe bill establishes a one-year holding period requirement for dividends of a domestic corporation to be eligible for a participation dividends received deduction.\n\n(Sec. 14102) This section sets forth requirements for the tax treatment of sales or transfers involving specified 10% owned foreign corporations, including (1) sales by U.S. persons of stock, (2) required reductions in the basis of certain foreign stock, and (3) sales by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC, (4) foreign branch loess transferred to specified 10% owned foreign corporations, and (5) the repeal of the active trade or business exception.\n\n(Sec. 14103) This section specifies rules for the tax treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to the participation exemption system of taxation.\n\nFor the last taxable year of a deferred foreign income corporation which begins before January 1, 2018, U.S. shareholders of deferred foreign income corporations must include as subpart F income a pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation.\n\nThe bill allows a deduction for a portion of the pro rata share of foreign earnings. The bill also disallows a corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes.\n\nThe total amount of deductions permitted is the amount necessary to result in tax rates of 15.5% for accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents and 8% rate for all other earnings.\n\nThe tax may be paid in installments over eight years.\n\nThe bill specifies rules for applying this provision to S corporations and real estate investment trusts.\n\nSubpart B--Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income\n\nChapter 1--Taxation Of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income And Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income\n\n(Sec. 14201) This section requires a U.S. shareholder of any CFC for any taxable year to include in gross income the shareholder's global intangible low-taxed income for the year.

Certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person must be attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation.\n\n(Sec. 14214) This section expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation.\n\n(Sec. 14215) This section eliminates the requirement for a corporation to be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply.\n\nChapter 3--Prevention Of Base Erosion\n\n(Sec. 14221) This section modifies terms and valuation methods that apply to transfers of intangible property. The bill modifies the definition of \"intangible property\" to include: (1) any goodwill, going concern value, or workforce in place (including its composition and terms and conditions [contractual or otherwise] of its employment); or (2) any other item the value or potential value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of any individual.\n\nThe bill removes a requirement that the item have substantial value independent of the services of an individual to be considered intangible property.\n\nThe bill specifies authorities and requirements for Treasury to specify the method to be used to determine the valuation of transfers of intangible property.\n\n(Sec. 14222) This section denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or accrued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity.\n\nA \"disqualified related party amount\" is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) the amount is not included in the income of such related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) the related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. The term does include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under this bill.\n\nA \"hybrid transaction\" is any transaction, series of transactions, agreement, or instrument one or more payments with respect to which are treated as interest or royalties under this bill and which are not so treated for purposes the tax law of the foreign country of which the recipient of such payment is resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax.\n\nA \"hybrid entity\" is any entity which is either: (1) treated as fiscally transparent under this bill but not for the purposes of the tax law of the foreign country of which the entity is a resident for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of such tax law but not so treated for purposes of this bill\n\n(Sec. 14223) Shareholders who receive dividends from a foreign corporation that first becomes a surrogate corporation after enactment of this bill are ineligible for the reduced rates for qualified dividends.\n\nSubpart C--Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System\n\n(Sec. 14301) This section repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10% or more of the voting stock of a foreign corporation.
