Within 30 days of the appeal, the Commissioner must either ensure compliance with the directive or provide a description of the reasons for any modification or rescission made or upheld pursuant to the appeal.\n\nThe bill also requires the NTA annual report to identify any directive that was not honored by the IRS in a timely manner, as required by this bill."
