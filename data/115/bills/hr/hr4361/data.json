    "text": "Accurate Budgeting Act \n\nThis bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Joint Committee on Taxation to incorporate a macroeconomic impact analysis in estimates of the budgetary effects of major revenue legislation to the extent that it is practicable.\n\nThe macroeconomic impact analysis, commonly referred to as dynamic scoring, includes:\n\n the changes in economic output, employment, interest rates, capital stock, and tax revenues expected to result from the proposal; revenue feedback (changes in revenue resulting from changes in economic growth as a result of the proposal); and the assumptions and data used for the estimate. The bill also amends the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) to require estimates of the budgetary effects of major revenue legislation prepared for purposes of PAYGO requirements to incorporate a macroeconomic impact analysis to the extent that it is practicable."
