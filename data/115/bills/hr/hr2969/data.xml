  <summary date="2017-06-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Move Ownership and Responsibility to Encourage Makerspaces Act of 2017 or the MORE Makerspaces Act

This bill amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 to require federal agencies to submit recommendations to the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget on federal civilian real properties that have sufficient square footage, technological capabilities, and community accessibility for use as makerspaces.

The bill defines "makerspace" as a community space that: (1) provides access to tools, technology, and knowledge for learners and entrepreneurs; (2) results in the prototyping or creation of physical goods; and (3) supports the development of educational opportunities for personal growth, workforce training, and early stage business ventures.

The Public Buildings Reform Board shall: (1) establish a review process through which federal agencies may lease or sell an abandoned or unused federal civilian real property for use as a makerspace; (2) establish an online public campaign to inform local municipalities of such process; and (3) when such a property is identified through such process, notify the Member of Congress in whose district such property is located so that such Member can inform the local municipality and community of the opportunity to use such property as a makerspace.</summary>
