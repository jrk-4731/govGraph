(Sec. 2) This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to require the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to establish a five-year demonstration program for nonprofit organizations and tribally designated housing entities to provide&#160;low-income rental-assistance vouchers to&#160;individuals recovering from an opioid or other substance-use disorder. Specifically,&#160;these vouchers shall be provided&#160;through a supportive housing program that provides treatment for such disorders and coordination with workforce development providers.

HUD may waive, or specify alternative requirements for, any provision of statute&#160;or regulation governing the use of these vouchers (except for requirements relating to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, or the environment) if such waiver or alternative is necessary.</summary>
