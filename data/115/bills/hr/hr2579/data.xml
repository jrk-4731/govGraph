  <summary date="2017-06-15T12:16:43Z" status="Passed House amended">(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 2, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Broader Options for Americans Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the premium assistance tax credit to be used for unsubsidized COBRA continuation health coverage.

(Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 [COBRA], an individual may continue to receive coverage under an employer-sponsored health plan after an event that would otherwise end coverage, such as a termination of employment. This bill applies to COBRA continuation coverage if the premiums are solely the obligation of the taxpayer.)

"COBRA continuation coverage" includes continuation coverage provided under:

 the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Public Health Service Act, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; a state law or program that provides comparable coverage; or a church plan that provides comparable coverage. It does not include coverage under a health flexible spending arrangement.

For the coverage to qualify for the tax credit, the plan administrator of the group health plan must certify that the COBRA continuation coverage meets the requirements for qualified health plans.

The bill is contingent on the enactment of the American Health Care Act of 2017 and applies (if at all) after December 31, 2019.</summary>
