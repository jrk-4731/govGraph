This bill requires airport air transportation security programs to include:

 training focused on active violence response, crowd management, mass evacuation, event recovery, and unified command, that is coordinated with security stakeholders, including all Transportation Security Administration employees at the airport; security and emergency preparedness training for all airport employees; a mass evacuation plan; a risk communications plan; a continuity of operations plan; and a family assistance and customer care plan. For a category X airport (a large airport that requires the highest level of security to address terrorist threats), such programs shall also include an integrated and unified operations center responsible for overseeing and directing security operations for the entire airport that is based on a formalized concept of operations and that provides direction and resources through a unified command structure. For smaller category I through IV airports, such programs shall include a formalized concept of operations and a unified command structure through which direction and resources are provided.</summary>
