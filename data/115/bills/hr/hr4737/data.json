For a category X airport (a large airport that requires the highest level of security to address terrorist threats), such programs shall also include an integrated and unified operations center responsible for overseeing and directing security operations for the entire airport that is based on a formalized concept of operations and that provides direction and resources through a unified command structure. For smaller category I through IV airports, such programs shall include a formalized concept of operations and a unified command structure through which direction and resources are provided."
