  <summary date="2018-02-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats Act of 2018

This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to consider recommendations of the National Advisory Council for best practices to maintain the integrity of the integrated public alert and warning system to protect against natural or man-made disasters, acts of terrorism, or threats to public safety.

FEMA shall: (1) establish a process to ensure that an incident management and warning tool used by a state, tribal, or local government to originate and transmit an alert through the system meets minimum requirements established by FEMA; and (2) review the memoranda of understanding between FEMA and state, tribal, and local governments regarding the system to ensure that all agreements comply with such requirements.

The authority to originate an alert warning the public of a missile launch directed against a state shall reside solely with the federal government. Upon verification of a missile threat, the President may activate the system.</summary>
