This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to remove substance use disorder services from the list of essential health benefits that must be covered by health plans.

The bill also amends the Fair Housing Act to address state and local zoning laws regarding recovery facilities (buildings that are occupied by individuals who are handicapped by drug addiction or alcoholism and that prohibit controlled substances and alcohol). The bill specifies that federal anti-discrimination laws do not bar any state or local zoning laws that prohibit recovery facilities in residential areas. Recovery facilities must also comply with all state and local zoning laws in order to receive federal funds.</summary>
