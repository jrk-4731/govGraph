  <summary date="2017-12-18T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">DIVISION A--DISASTER ASSISTANCE

Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 

This division provides $81 billion in FY2018 emergency appropriations to several federal agencies for disaster assistance related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; and wildfires that occurred in 2017. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)

DIVISION B--DISASTER RECOVERY REFORM ACT

This division amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to modify the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster response and recovery programs.

DIVISION C--OTHER MATTERS

This division amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to designate cottonseed as a covered commodity beginning with the 2018 crop year. (Producers of covered commodities are eligible for Department of Agriculture [USDA] price and income support programs such as the Price Loss Coverage program.)

It also amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to remove the $20 million cap on annual expenditures for livestock producers under the federal crop insurance program.

The bill requires all states to participate in USDA's National Accuracy Clearinghouse, which is a database for states to use to prevent Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) participants from receiving duplicative benefits in multiple states. (The clearinghouse is currently a pilot program with five participating states.)

DIVISION D--BUDGETARY EFFECTS

This division exempts the budgetary effects of division B and each succeeding division of this bill from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) and other budget enforcement rules.</summary>
