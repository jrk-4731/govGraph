(Sec. 104) DOE shall ensure that laboratory operating contractors do not allocate costs of general and administrative overhead to laboratory-directed research and development. This prohibition does not apply to certain national security laboratories.\n\n(Sec. 105) DOE shall establish and maintain a public database, accessible on its website, containing a searchable listing of each unclassified research and development project contract, grant, cooperative agreement, task order for a federally funded research and development center, or other DOE-administered transaction.\n\nDOE shall provide information through such database on relevant literature and patents that are associated with each such project contract, grant, or cooperative agreement, or other transaction, of DOE.\n\n(Sec. 106) Within one year of enactment of this bill and as often as determined to be necessary thereafter, DOE shall report on its ability to successfully transfer new energy technologies to the private sector.\n\n(Sec. 107) DOE shall carry out the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program in accordance with this bill, including by giving the contractors of the national laboratories increased authority to negotiate contract terms and making every such facility eligible for the program. The pilot program is extended through FY2019.\n\n DOE shall permit the directors of the national laboratories to execute agreements with non-federal entities.\n\n The bill: (1) subjects funding agreements to the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act (concerning patent rights to inventions arising from federally-supported research and development), and (2) imposes contractor certification requirements for the avoidance of direct competition with the private sector and conflicts of interest.\n\n(Sec. 108) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to exempt institutions of higher education and nonprofit institutions from the cost-sharing requirements for research and development for two years.\n\nDuring such period, DOE shall submit an initial report, then subsequent annual reports, that describe the use of cost-sharing waivers by DOE with regard to carrying out research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs and activities that have been initiated since August 9, 2005.\n\nTITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH COORDINATION\n\nDepartment of Energy Research Coordination Act\n\n(Sec. 202) The bill amends the America Competes Act to require the following types of information collected by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) from recipients of financial assistance awards to be considered commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential and therefore not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act:\n\n plans for commercialization of technologies developed under the award, investments provided to an awardee from third parties, additional financial support that the awardee plans to or has invested into the technology developed under the award or is seeking from third parties, and revenue from the licensing or sale of new products or services that result from the research conducted under the award. (Sec. 203) DOE shall use its capabilities to identify strategic opportunities for collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of innovative science and technologies.\n\nDOE shall seek to leverage existing DOE programs and consolidate and coordinate activities throughout DOE to promote collaboration and crosscutting approaches within its programs.\n\nAlso, DOE shall:\n\n prioritize activities that use all affordable domestic resources; develop a planning, evaluation, and technical assessment framework for setting long-term objective strategic goals and evaluating progress that ensures integrity and independence and provides the flexibility to adapt to market dynamics; ensure that activities do not duplicate other activities within DOE or other federal government activities; and identify programs that may be more effectively left to the states, industry, nongovernmental organizations, institutions of higher education, or other stakeholders. (Sec. 204) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require DOE, when periodically reviewing all of its science and technology activities in a strategic framework, to also take global energy dynamics into account under such a review.\n\nPlans developed by DOE to improve coordination and collaboration in research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities across DOE's organizational boundaries shall also include:\n\n critical assessments of any ongoing programs that have experienced subpar performance or cost overruns of 10% or more over 1 or more years; any activities that may be more effectively left to the states, industry, nongovernmental organizations, institutions of higher education, or other stakeholders; and evaluations and proposals for innovation hubs, institutes, and research centers of DOE, including an affirmation that they will advance DOE's mission, prioritize research, development, and demonstration, and that those that are established or renewed within the Office of Science are consistent with its mission. (Sec. 205) The bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require DOE to submit a report for FY2018 concerning the development and implementation of a strategy for facilities and infrastructure supported at certain DOE offices, the national laboratories, and single-purpose research facilities.\n\n(Sec. 206) DOE shall carry out a program to enhance economic, environmental, and energy security by making awards to consortia for the establishment and operation of Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct and support at one centralized location, multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced energy technologies.\n\nDOE shall: (1) designate a unique advanced energy technology basic research focus for each hub, and (2) ensure coordination and avoid unnecessary duplication of each hub's activities with those of other DOE research entities.\n\nTo become eligible to receive an award to establish and operate a hub, a consortium must:\n\n be composed of at least two qualifying entities; operate subject to a binding agreement, entered into by each consortium member, which documents the proposed partnership agreement, including the governance and management structure of the hub; and operate as a nonprofit organization. Each hub shall conduct or provide for multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced energy technologies.\n\nIn addition, each hub shall:\n\n encourage collaboration and communication among the members of the qualifying entities of the consortium and awardees; develop and publish proposed plans and programs on a publicly accessible website; submit annual reports to DOE summarizing its activities; monitor project implementation and coordination; and maintain conflict of interest procedures, consistent with those of DOE.
