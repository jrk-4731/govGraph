and </li> <li>whether a single new facility that substantially addresses magnetic fusion and next generation fission materials research needs is feasible, in conjunction with the expected capabilities of facilities that are operational as of this bill's enactment. </li> </ul> <p>The office shall support: (1) research and development activities and facility operations to optimize the tokamak approach to fusion energy, and (2) research and development activities for inertial fusion for energy applications. </p> <p>The office shall support research and development activities and facility operations at institutions of higher education, national laboratories, and private facilities for a portfolio of alternative and enabling fusion energy concepts that may provide solutions to significant challenges to the establishment of a commercial magnetic fusion power plant, to be prioritized based on the ability of the United States to play a leadership role in the international fusion research community. </p> <p>The office shall coordinate with ARPA-E to: (1) assess the potential for any ARPA-E-supported fusion energy project as representing an approach to a viable fusion power plant that is commercially viable, (2) determine whether the results of any such project merit the support of follow-on research activities carried out by the office, and (3) avoid unintentional duplication of activities. </p> <p> DOE shall submit to Congress a report on the fusion energy research and development activities that the DOE proposes to carry out over a period of 10 years under at least 3 budget scenarios, including one based on 3% annual growth in the non-ITER portion of the budget for those activities. </p> <p>Such report shall: </p> <ul> <li>identify specific areas of fusion energy research and enabling technology development in which the United States can and should establish or solidify a lead in global fusion energy development; </li> <li>identify priorities for the initiation of facility construction and facility decommissioning under each of the three budget scenarios; and </li> <li>assess the ability of the U.S. fusion workforce to carry out these activities, including the adequacy of programs at institutions of higher education in the United States in training the leaders and workers of the next generation of fusion energy researchers. </li> </ul> <p>To develop such report, DOE shall leverage best practices and lessons learned from the process used to develop the most recent report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel. </p> <p>(Sec. 308) The Office of Science: (1) may carry out a program for the production of isotopes; and (2) shall ensure that isotope production activities do not compete with private industry, unless critical national interests require the involvement of the federal government. </p> <p>The Rare Isotope Accelerator is renamed as the &quot;Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.&quot;</p> <p>(Sec. 309) The Office of Science shall carry out a program for improving the safety, efficiency, and mission readiness of infrastructure at its laboratories. </p> <p>Such program shall include projects to:</p> <ul> <li>renovate or replace space that does not meet research needs,</li> <li>replace facilities that are no longer cost-effective to renovate or operate,</li> <li>modernize utility systems to prevent failures and ensure efficiency, </li> <li>remove excess facilities to allow safe and efficient operations, and </li> <li>construct modern facilities to conduct advanced research in controlled environmental conditions. </li> </ul>]]></text>
