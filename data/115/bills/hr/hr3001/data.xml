 This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to: (1) establish a Multimodal Freight Funding Formula Program to distribute funds to states, and a National Freight Infrastructure Competitive Grant Program to make grants to entities for projects, to improve the efficiency and reliability of freight movement in the United States.

The bill: (1) requires national and state freight plans to include strategies and goals to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, local air pollution, water runoff, and wildlife habitat loss; and (2) expands the membership and duties of state freight advisory committees.&#160;&#160;

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) impose a 1% excise tax upon taxable ground transportation of property (i.e., transportation by freight rail or truck trailer and semitrailer chassis and bodies, suitable for use with a trailer or semitrailer with a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds or more), and (2) deposit such tax revenues into a Freight Trust Fund to finance the Multimodal Freight Funding Formula Program and the National Freight Infrastructure Competitive Grant Program.</summary>
