For FY2018-FY2022, the bill authorizes specified amounts. For FY2023 and each subsequent fiscal year, the bill authorizes amounts using a specified formula.\n\nThe bill also amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to modify the discretionary spending limits for FY2018-FY2021. For each fiscal year, the bill decreases the limit for security spending by a specified amount and increases the limit for nonsecurity spending by the same amount.\u00a0The\u00a0nonsecurity spending increases are the same amounts as are authorized in the\u00a0bill\u00a0for additional funding under the IDEA in\u00a0those fiscal years.\u00a0"
