A participating county may reallocate funds for a different use than authorized only after the 45-day public comment period has ended, at the beginning of which the county shall publish a description of how it proposes to use the funds.\n\nThe bill extends the authority for the initiation of county projects until the end of FY2019 and allows county funds to remain available until expended."
