This bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to report to Congress on recidivism.

Additionally, the bill directs the BJS to provide technical assistance for states to implement best practices to combat gangs.

 DOJ must also evaluate and report to Congress on the effectiveness of DOJ programs in combating gangs.</summary>
