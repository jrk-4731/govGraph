  <summary date="2017-11-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to increase the payment limitation for certain Department of Agriculture supplemental agricultural disaster assistance programs. The bill increases from $125,000 to $250,000 the total amount of disaster assistance payments that may be received under all of the programs by a person or legal entity (excluding a joint venture or general partnership) for any crop year. (Under current law, the payment limitation applies to the Livestock Forage Program; the Livestock Indemnity Program; and the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program.)</summary>
