This bill grants an engineer for a public agency that receives funds from the Federal Highway Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) , or the Department of Agriculture (USDA), in accordance with state and local procurement requirements, maximum flexibility to select appropriate construction materials that meet the performance requirements of a public contract and that allows open and free competition among suppliers of construction materials, notwithstanding federal procurement requirements. A state or local government may not prohibit or restrict any such engineer from using a particular construction material.

 The Department of Transportation, the EPA, the Corps of Engineers, and USDA shall establish an interagency task force which shall issue a comprehensive report on federally-funded infrastructure projects.</summary>
