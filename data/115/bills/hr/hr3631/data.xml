  <summary date="2017-07-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Family Leave for Parental Involvement in Education Act

This bill entitles an employee covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to take up to 8 hours during any 30-day period, and up to 48 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to participate in or attend school conferences or activities sponsored by a school or community organization and related to a program attended by the employee's child or grandchild.

An employee may elect, or an employer may require, substitution of any of the employee's paid or family leave or paid medical or sick leave for any leave allowed under this bill.

Nothing in this bill shall require an employer to grant paid sick leave or paid medical leave in situations where the employer would not normally grant it.

The bill imposes on the employee requesting leave certain notification requirements. An employer may require certification supporting such requests.

The bill also applies the parental involvement and family wellness leave allowance to federal employees.</summary>
