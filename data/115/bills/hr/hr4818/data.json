It also rescinds the earmarked funds effective on the date the funds are made available.\n\nAn \"earmark\" is a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member of Congress providing, authorizing, or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific state, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process.\n\nEach agency must submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) an annual report identifying each earmark that is ineligible for funding under this bill. OMB must then submit to Congress and publish on its website an annual report detailing the identified earmarks and the annual savings resulting from this bill."
