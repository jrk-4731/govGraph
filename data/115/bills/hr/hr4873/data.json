    "text": "DACA Compromise Act of 2018\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel the removal of, and adjust to permanent resident status the status of, an alien: (1) who has been continuously present in the United States since June 15, 2012; (2) who was granted deferred removal as an undocumented alien pursuant to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, unless the individual engaged in subsequent conduct that would have rendered the alien ineligible for program renewal; (3) who applies for adjustment not earlier than two years after he or she was granted such deferred removal; (4) who otherwise satisfies the requirements of this bill, and (5) to whom an immigrant visa is available.\n\nThe bill reallocates specified family, employment, and diversity visas for such approved individuals.\n\nDHS shall allow eligible individuals, including minors, to apply for relief without requiring: (1) placement in removal proceedings, or (2) immediate immigrant visa availability.\n\nDHS shall provide a reasonable opportunity to apply for relief under this bill to any alien who: (1) requests such an opportunity, or (2) appears prima facie eligible for relief if the alien is in removal proceedings or is the subject of a final removal or voluntary departure order.\n\nAn applicant for permanent resident status shall: (1) submit biometric and biographic data, (2) undergo law enforcement and security background checks and a medical examination, and (3) meet applicable selective service registration requirements.\n\nThe Department of Justice may not remove certain individuals who: (1) have a pending application and appear prima facie eligible for relief, (2) have an approved application and are awaiting the availability of an immigrant visa, or (3) are ineligible to apply for relief solely due to the date limitation for applying for adjustment under this bill. DHS shall provide provisional protected status to such individuals whose DACA grant has ended."
