This bill allows state and local governments to recover their costs for providing protection to government officials and other individuals allowed Secret Service protection who travel to those jurisdictions for a period of more than 24 hours to visit real property in which such officials or individuals, or their spouses, have any ownership interest. The bill also grants a recovery right to any business that is significantly adversely affected by the provision of such protection.

The Secret Service shall report to the homeland security committees of Congress detailing the costs of protecting officials and individuals granted such protection since January 20, 2017.

The bill waives the sovereign immunity of the United States ito the extent required to enable the recovery of costs allowed by this bill.</summary>
