  <summary date="2017-09-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to establish two care-management demonstration programs for chronic kidney disease (CKD) under the Medicare program: (1) the CKD Early Detection and Treatment Demonstration Program, and (2) the Demonstration Program for Advanced CKD. A practitioner's participation in either program&#160;shall be&#160;optional.

Through&#160;each program, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)&#160;shall provide to&#160;an enrollee's participating primary-care practitioner a single, monthly, performance-based payment for covered CKD care-management services furnished to the enrollee. The amount of&#160;this payment shall be greater than the amount that the practitioner would otherwise have received under Medicare for furnishing such services to the enrollee.&#160; The CMS shall specify applicable performance measures, in accordance with clinical guidelines.</summary>
