This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a broadband Internet access service provider from: (1) blocking lawful content, applications, or services, subject to reasonable network management; (2) charging a fee to avoid blocking of the content, applications, or services provided; or (3) prohibiting, restricting, or penalizing the use of non-harmful devices on the network of the provider, subject to reasonable network management.

Such a provider may not: (1) impair, degrade, slow down, speed up, or enhance lawful Internet traffic on the basis of Internet content, application, source, destination, service, or use of a non-harmful device; or (2) charge a provider a fee to avoid the impairment, degradation, or slowing down of Internet traffic of the provider, or for the speeding up or enhancement of such traffic, on the basis of Internet content.

 A provider shall: (1) publicly disclose accurate and relevant information regarding the network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of the broadband Internet access services of such provider sufficient for consumers to make informed choices; and (2) interconnect and exchange Internet Protocol traffic on a settlement-free basis, subject to specified requirements.

It shall be unlawful for a provider to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices.

Broadband Internet access services shall be eligible to receive funding from authorized federal universal service support mechanisms.</summary>
