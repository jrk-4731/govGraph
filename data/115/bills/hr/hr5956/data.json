Workers under permits must be paid the highest of CNMI minimum wage, federal minimum wage, or the prevailing wage for the occupation. The bill provides for renewal of permits and three-year permits for workers permitted since FY2015.\n\nThe bill caps the number of permits that may be issued each fiscal year. The cap is lowered each year."
