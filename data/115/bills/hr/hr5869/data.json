In preparing the threat analysis, DHS shall consider and examine:\n\n technology and personnel needs and challenges; the role of state, territorial, and local law enforcement in general border security activities; the need for cooperation among federal, state, territorial, local, and appropriate international law enforcement entities relating to border security; the geographic challenges of the maritime border; and the impact and consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate on general border security activities relating to the maritime border."
