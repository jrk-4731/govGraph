This bill requires the Department of State to design, establish, and make publicly known a Vulnerability Disclosure Process to improve cybersecurity. The process requirements include: (1) identifying which information technology should be included, (2) providing a readily available means of reporting discovered security vulnerabilities, and (3) identifying the offices and position that will be responsible for addressing security vulnerability disclosures.

The bill requires the State Department to establish a bug bounty pilot program to provide compensation for reports of previously unidentified security vulnerabilities of its internet-facing information technology.</summary>
