This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for eligible individuals who reside in states in which the federal tax burden of the state exceeds the federal outlays received by the state.

An "eligible individual" is an individual who is: (1) the taxpayer, the spouse of the taxpayer, or a dependent of the taxpayer; (2) a citizen of the United States or lawfully present in the United States; and (3) a resident of the state for more than half of the year. The term does not include an estate, trust, or an individual for whom another taxpayer is allowed a deduction for a personal exemption.</summary>
