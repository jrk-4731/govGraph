Pennsylvania shall erect signs identifying such corridor as Interstate Route 99.\n\nThe Department of Transportation is authorized to make grants to Pennsylvania for projects to:\n\n erect signs identifying the segment designated by this bill as part of the Interstate System (IS), and make improvements as necessary for such segment to conform with applicable IS standards. The bill permits vehicles that could operate legally on such segment before its designation as part of the IS to continue to operate on such segment without regard to IS vehicle weight limitations."
