  <summary date="2018-02-07T14:21:56Z" status="Passed House amended">Ukraine Cybersecurity Cooperation Act of 2017

(Sec. 3) This bill states that is U.S. policy to: (1) reaffirm the United States-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership, which highlights the bilateral relationship's importance and outlines enhanced cooperation in defense, security, economics and trade, energy security, and democracy; (2) support continued cooperation between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine; (3) support Ukraine's political and economic reforms; (4) reaffirm the commitment of the United States to the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances; (5) assist Ukraine's efforts to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities; and (6) improve Ukraine's ability to respond to Russian-supported disinformation and propaganda efforts in cyberspace, including through social media.

(Sec. 4) It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State should take the following actions, commensurate with U.S. interests, to help Ukraine improve its cybersecurity: (1) provide Ukraine necessary support to secure government computer networks from cyber intrusions, particularly networks that defend critical infrastructure; (2) provide Ukraine support to reduce reliance on Russian information and communications technology; and (3) help Ukraine build capacity, expand cybersecurity information sharing, and cooperate on international cyberspace efforts.

 The State Department shall report to Congress on U.S.-Ukraine cybersecurity cooperation. Such report shall also include information on: (1) U.S. efforts to strengthen Ukraine's ability to prevent and respond to cyber incidents; (2) the potential for new areas of U.S.-Ukraine mutual assistance in addressing shared cyber challenges, including cyber crime, critical infrastructure protection, and resilience against botnets and other automated, distributed threats; and (3) NATO's efforts to help Ukraine develop technical capabilities to counter cyber threats.</summary>
