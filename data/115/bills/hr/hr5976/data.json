The bill establishes limitations on grant amounts and how grant funds may be used.\n\nTo be eligible to receive such a grant, a state shall: (1) provide matching funds equal to at least 25% of the grant amount; and (2) provide any information that the Department of Education may require, as specified by the bill.\n\nA state may request a waiver of certain grant requirements that are incompatible with aspects of the state's governmental structure."
