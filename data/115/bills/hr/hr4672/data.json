The bill authorizes additional appropriations for these grants through FY2022.\n\nThe Office\u00a0shall provide support to entities in addressing cybersecurity issues related to Next Generation 911 services.\u00a0The National Institute of Standards and Technology must identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities unique to implementing Next Generation 911 services, recommend best practices and assistance that the federal government can\u00a0provide,\u00a0and report its recommendations for protecting such services.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must report about the adoption and adherence by: (1) telecommunications carriers to the FCC's network reliability best practices, and (2)\u00a0public safety answering points to the public safety answering point\u00a0best practices for cybersecurity as recommended by the Task Force on Optimal Public Safety Answering Point Architecture.\u00a0(A public safety answering point is a facility designated to receive emergency calls and route the calls\u00a0to emergency service personnel.)\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report about the resiliency, reliability, and survivability of public safety answering points during natural disasters and other catastrophes."
