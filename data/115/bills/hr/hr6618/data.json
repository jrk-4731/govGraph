DHS may designate any country as a program country if its meets specified requirements.\n\nThe Department of State must (1) require diplomatic and consular missions to conduct nonimmigrant visa application interviews expeditiously and set a goal of interviewing visa applicants, worldwide, within 15 days of application receipt; (2) develop and conduct a pilot program for processing visas using secure remote videoconferencing technology for conducting visa interviews; and (3) seek to coordinate enrollment and interview processes for individuals eligible for both a U.S. visa and enrollment in the Global Entry program operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection."
