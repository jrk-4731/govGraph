Specifically, this immunity shall\u00a0apply to certain credit-union, depository-institution, investment-adviser, broker-dealer,\u00a0transfer-agency, insurance-company,\u00a0and insurance-agency employees who\u00a0have\u00a0received specified training related\u00a0to identifying\u00a0and reporting\u00a0the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen. Similarly,\u00a0the employing\u00a0financial institution shall not be liable with respect to\u00a0disclosures made by such employees.\n\n(Sec. 302) The bill allows financial institutions and third-party entities to offer training related to the suspected financial exploitation of a senior citizen to specified employees. The bill provides guidance regarding the content, timing, and record-maintenance requirements of such training."
