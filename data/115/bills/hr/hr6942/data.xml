This bill authorizes the Department of Justice to award grants to states to provide legal counsel to low-income individuals in civil actions related to evictions.

The Government Accountability Office must study and report to Congress on evictions in the United States, including the rate of legal representation of tenants and landlords, the effect of full representation on eviction cases, and the potential cost savings from providing representation.</summary>
