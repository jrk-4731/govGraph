Such review shall have priority of consideration to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nThe bill states that: (1) the designation authority under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to appoint an individual to assume the rights of a victim who is under 18 years old or incompetent is discretionary, and (2) such designation is not required if the military judge determines that a victim who is under 18 years old can adequately represent his or her own interests."
