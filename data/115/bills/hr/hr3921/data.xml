 TITLE I--CHIP EXTENSION AND OTHER MEDICAID AND CHIP PROVISIONS

(Sec. 101) This bill extends funding through FY2022 for&#160;the&#160;Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project.

In addition, the bill reauthorizes through FY2022:

 the qualifying-states option (which allows states that provided coverage to now CHIP-eligible children prior to CHIP's enactment to continue to provide such coverage), and the express-lane eligibility option (which allows states to use eligibility findings from other public benefit programs to determine&#160;children's eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP). Beginning in FY2020, the bill allows&#160;state child-health plans&#160;to adopt more restrictive eligibility standards with respect to children in families whose income exceeds 300% of the poverty line.

(Sec. 102) The bill extends funding through FY2022 for the Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project and the Pediatric Quality Measures Program.

(Sec. 103) The bill: (1)&#160;extends funding through FY2022 for specified outreach and enrollment grants, and (2) makes eligible for such grants "parent-mentors" who are trained to assist families with children who have no health-insurance coverage.

(Sec. 104) Current law provides states with an enhanced Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for child-health assistance through FY2019. The bill&#160;maintains the&#160;enhanced FMAP&#160;in FY2020, but&#160;halves the&#160;percentage-point increase.

(Sec. 105) The bill eliminates Medicaid payment reductions&#160;for disproportionate-share hospitals (which receive additional payment under Medicaid for treating a large share of low-income patients)&#160;in FY2018, but extends such reductions by two years (through FY2027).

(Sec. 106) The bill also increases Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands through FY2019. Such funding&#160;shall be further increased through 2019 for both territories if Puerto Rico takes specified actions&#160;to improve its&#160;Medicaid program.

TITLE II--OFFSETS

(Sec. 201) The bill alters provisions related to third-party liability under Medicaid and CHIP.

(Sec. 202) The bill specifies how a state must treat qualified lottery winnings and lump-sum income for purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility.

(Sec. 203) The bill eliminates&#160;Medicare premium subsidies&#160;for beneficiaries with annual incomes&#160;exceeding $500,000.</summary>
