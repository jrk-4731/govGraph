  <summary date="2018-07-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Zero Tolerance for Illegal Entry Act

This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to increase from a misdemeanor to a felony a first-time illegal entry into the United States. It also withholds federal assistance from sanctuary jurisdictions and transfers amounts appropriated for public works and housing programs for those jurisdictions to the Department of Homeland Security for border control and the enforcement of the immigration laws.

Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act

The bill makes the E-Verify program permanent. It requires mandatory participation in the program by federal agencies, critical employers, and contractors and imposes increased fines for failure to participate. It also expands E-Verify to confirm the employment eligibility of existing employees not previously verified and to require employers to terminate an employee following the receipt of a final E-Verify nonconfirmation.

The bill amends the federal criminal code to impose enhanced criminal penalties and fines for facilitating or assisting in harboring or hiring unauthorized workers in violation of the immigration laws.</summary>
