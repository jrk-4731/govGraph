This bill amends the Mineral Leasing Act to provide a mechanism for states to receive their entitled percentage of sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals for all public land or deposits located in the state.

The bill eliminates the 2% fee that the federal government currently deducts from a state's entitled share to cover administrative or other costs.

On request of a state, the Department of the Interior must convey to the state their entitled percentage of all right, title, and interest for all public land or deposits located in the state.Interior must provide prompt notice of any such conveyance and the duty of the leaseholder to make direct payments to the state.</summary>
