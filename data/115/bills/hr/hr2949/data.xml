 This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow two borrowers, who had previously received a joint consolidation loan for their student debt under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, to submit a joint application to sever their consolidated loan. One borrower may submit a separate application in the event that the individual is experiencing domestic or economic abuse from the other individual borrower, or is unable to reasonably reach or access the loan information of the other borrower.</summary>
