  <summary date="2017-04-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the federal criminal code to increase to five years the ban on individuals appointed to executive schedule positions (except special government employees who serve less than 60 days in a 1-year period) from engaging in lobbying activities in the executive branch.

The Office of Government Ethics may waive lobbying restriction for certain executive schedule employees if it determines that the restrictions would create an undue hardship in obtaining qualified personnel for agency positions and granting such waiver would not create the potential for use of undue influence or unfair advantage.

The bill increases to five years the ban on lobbying activities by Senators or Members of the House of Representatives.</summary>
