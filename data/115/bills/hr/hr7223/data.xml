This bill requires drug manufacturers with Medicaid rebate agreements for covered outpatient drugs to disclose drug product information. Manufacturers are subject to civil penalties for knowingly misclassifying drugs. Manufacturers are also required to compensate for rebates that were initially underpaid as a result of misclassification (whether or not such misclassification was committed knowingly).</summary>
