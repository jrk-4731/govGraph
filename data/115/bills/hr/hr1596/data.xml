This bill establishes a commission to study the potential for creating a National Museum of Irish American History.

The commission shall report to the President and Congress on:

 its recommendations for a plan of action for the establishment of the museum in Washington, DC; the availability and cost of the collections to be acquired and housed; the impact of the museum on regional Irish-American-related museums; whether the museum should be located within the Smithsonian Institution; the governance and organizational structure of the museum; how to engage the Irish-American community in the museum's development and design; and the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining the museum. The commission shall: (1) develop and obtain an independent review of a fund-raising plan to support the museum through public contributions, and (2) submit recommendations for a legislative plan of action for the creation and construction of the museum.

The commission may host a national conference on the museum for individuals who are committed to the advancement of Irish-American life, art, history, and culture.</summary>
