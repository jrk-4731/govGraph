The commission shall: (1) develop and obtain an independent review of a fund-raising plan to support the museum through public contributions, and (2) submit recommendations for a legislative plan of action for the creation and construction of the museum.\n\nThe commission may host a national conference on the museum for individuals who are committed to the advancement of Irish-American life, art, history, and culture."
