The Commission shall advise DOD on proposed reforms to commissary and exchange operations that could affect:\n\n the use of revenue; the morale, welfare, and recreation programs provided for, and the morale of, military members and dependents; and philanthropic programs that benefit members and their families. The bill requires DOD to: (1) report annually on the use of funds generated by commissaries and exchanges, the constitution and purpose of the boards of directors of the Military Exchanges and Commissary Operations and any determination to use such funds, and DOD responses to any commission proposals; (2) notify Congress before expending certain funds; and (3) notify Congress before taking action that would reduce a contract awarded by the Defense Commissary Agency to a small, veteran-owned, woman-owned, or disadvantaged business concern or a qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or other severely disabled."
