This bill allows an employee or Member of Congress who has performed military service and who retires on or after September 8, 1982, to make the deposit required for crediting such service under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) at any time before or after the date of separation on which the entitlement to an annuity under CSRS is based.

Such a deposit made after separation, and the annuity or lump-sum payable after such deposit, is required to include computed interest.

The retirement counselor training program is revised to promote fully informed retirement decisions in the case of employees and Members who served in the Armed Forces regarding the crediting of military service.</summary>
