This bill sets forth diplomatic post design and construction requirements.

The Department of State shall:

 use the design-build project delivery system in which one entity works under a single contract to provide design and construction services at diplomatic posts that have not yet received design or construction contracts, develop a vertical standard design for diplomatic posts that are to be situated on smaller plots of land, adapt the design that utilizes a standardized design template with design-build project delivery at diplomatic posts that require a more customized design, and consult with Congress regarding any diplomatic post project that utilizes a non-standard design.</summary>
