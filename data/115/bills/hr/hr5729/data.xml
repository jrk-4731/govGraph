(Sec.2)This bill prohibits the U.S. Coast Guard from: (1) implementing the rule titled "Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)-Reader Requirements," and (2) proposing or issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule that would require the use of biometric readers for biometric transportation security cards.

These prohibitions end 60 days after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submits to Congress an assessment of the transportation security card program.

(Sec.3) DHS must report to Congress on implementation of the transportation security card program within 30 days of the bill's enactment and every 90 days after that until it completes the assessment.</summary>
