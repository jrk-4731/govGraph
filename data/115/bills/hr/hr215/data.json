(Restricted fee tribal land is land that is owned by a tribe and has restrictions against alienation and taxation.)\n\nTribes may lease, or grant an easement or right-of-way on, restricted fee land for any period of time without Interior's review and approval.\n\nTribal laws that establish a system of land tenure governing the use of restricted fee land have precedence over federal laws and regulations governing the use of such land, except the restriction against the land's alienation and taxation."
