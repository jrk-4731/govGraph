This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to: (1) carry out a four-year pilot program in five Veterans Health Administration facilities to provide outpatient dental services and treatment, and related dental appliances, to eligible veterans at no cost; and (2) determine whether there is a correlation between veterans receiving such services and their suffering fewer complications of chronic ailments, thereby yielding a lower cost of care.

"Eligible veterans" means veterans who are:

 enrolled in, but not eligible for dental care under, the VA's health care program; between 40 and 70 years of age; and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Applicants shall receive an initial periodontal evaluation. Those diagnosed with periodontal disease that requires surgery shall be disqualified.

The VA shall enroll at least 1,500 eligible veterans, one-third of whom shall have been diagnosed with no or mild periodontitis and two-thirds of whom shall have been diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis.</summary>
