Applicants shall receive an initial periodontal evaluation. Those diagnosed with periodontal disease that requires surgery shall be disqualified.\n\nThe VA shall enroll at least 1,500 eligible veterans, one-third of whom shall have been diagnosed with no or mild periodontitis and two-thirds of whom shall have been diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis."
