    "text": "Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act\n\nThis bill transitions away from fossil fuel sources of energy to clean energy sources (e.g., energy efficiency, energy conservation, and renewable energy).\n\n By 2027: (1) 80% of electricity sold must be generated from clean energy resources, (2) 80% of new vehicle sales from manufacturers must be sales of zero-emission vehicles, and (3) 80% of train rail lines and train engines must be electrified. By 2035: (1) 100% of electricity must be generated from clean energy resources, (2) 100% of vehicle sales from manufacturers must be zero-emission vehicles, and (3) 100% of train rail lines and train engines must be electrified.\n\nThe bill establishes a car allowance rebate system within the Department of Transportation to provide economic incentives for consumers to purchase new, clean energy vehicles.\n\nNo federal permits for new major fossil fuel projects may be issued in 2018 and thereafter.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) terminate specified fossil fuel subsidies, (2) permanently extend renewable electricity production tax credits for electricity generated from wind, and (3) permanently extend a business energy investment tax credit for solar or wind energy technologies.\n\nA Community Assistance Fund is established for specified industrial and energy efficiency programs.\n\nThe bill permanently reauthorizes the Weatherization Assistance Program, which provides energy efficiency retrofits of low-income homes.\n\nIt prohibits exports of domestically produced crude oil and natural gas, including liquefied natural gas.\n\nThe Center for Clean Energy Workforce Development is established within the Department of Labor."
