(Specialty crops are fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and horticulture and nursery crops, including floriculture.)\n\nThe program must include at least one prize competition for solutions to automate or alleviate stresses on the workforce during each of the following:\n\n the planting of specialty crops, tasks associated with the management of specialty crops, the harvesting of specialty crops, and processing and preparing specialty crops for distribution. USDA must assemble prize committees to determine the scope, details, requirements, judging criteria, and incentives for each competition."
