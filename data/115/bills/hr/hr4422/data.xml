This bill amends the federal criminal code to modify provisions, commonly known as the Hobbs Act, that prohibit committing robbery or extortion in a manner which, in any way or degree, obstructs interstate commerce.

Specifically, the bill exempts from the prohibition conduct that: (1) is incidental to otherwise peaceful picketing during a labor dispute; (2) consists solely of minor bodily injury, minor property damage, or threats of such minor injury or damage; and (3) is not part of a pattern of violent conduct or of a coordinated violent activity. Such exempted conduct is subject to prosecution only by state and local authorities.</summary>
