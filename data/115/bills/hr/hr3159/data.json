    "text": "Family Business Preservation Estate Tax Act \n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the estate tax, to allow the value of the taxable estate to be reduced by the adjusted value of family-owned business interests that: (1) are included in determining the value of the gross estate, and (2) are acquired by or passed to an heir from the decedent.\n\nThe deduction may not exceed the greater of: (1) the basic exclusion amount in effect for the calendar year that includes the death of the decedent ($5.49 million for 2017), or (2) the value of farmland which constitutes the family-owned business interest.\n\nThe bill imposes a specified additional estate tax if, within 10 years of the decedent's death and before the heir's death: (1) material participation requirements are not met with respect to the family-owned business interest, (2) the heir disposes of any portion of the family-owned business interest (other than by a disposition to a member of the heir's family or through a qualified conservation contribution), (3) the heir loses U.S. citizenship or ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and the interest was not acquired or is not held in a qualified trust, or (4) the principal place of business of a trade or business of the family-owned business ceases to be located in the United States."
