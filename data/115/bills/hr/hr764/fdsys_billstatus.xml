          <text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Housing America's Workforce Act of 201</strong><b>7 </b></p> <p> This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employers a business-related tax credit for up to 50% (100% for small business employers) of the qualified housing expenses paid for the benefit of their employees. The bill defines &quot;qualified housing expenses&quot; to include homeownership assistance and rental assistance. The bill limits the annual amount of such credit per employee to the lesser of $10,000 or 6% of an employee's home purchase price, or up to $5,000 for rental assistance, adjusted for inflation after 2017. The bill excludes from employee gross income the value of employer-paid housing assistance.</p> <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may award grants in FY2017-FY2019, on a competitive basis, to nonprofit housing organizations or local governments for certain costs, including operating costs and technical assistance costs, of employer-assisted housing programs. HUD must establish a national clearinghouse, including a website, to provide information about employer-assisted housing programs to federal, state, and local governments; and other interested entities. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must conduct a study of employer-assisted housing programs and provide HUD with an interim report by January 1, 2020, and final report by December 31, 2021. </p>]]></text>
