  <summary date="2019-01-10T21:31:38Z" status="Public Law">(Sec. 1) This bill authorizes any landowner within the Northport Irrigation District in Nebraska to repay, at any time, the construction costs of project facilities allocated to the landowner's land within the district. Upon discharge in full of the obligation for repayment of all such costs, the parcels of land may not be subject to the ownership and full-cost pricing limitations under federal reclamation law. The Department of the Interior, upon request, must provide to the landowner who has repaid such costs in full a certificate acknowledging that the landholding is free of such limitations.</summary>
