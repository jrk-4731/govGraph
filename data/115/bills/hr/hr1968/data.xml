This bill authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD), in order to mitigate the threat of an unmanned aircraft system or unmanned aircraft to the safety or security of a covered facility or asset or to classified information, to take actions or authorize the Armed Forces or DOD contractors to take actions to: (1) disrupt, seize control of, or confiscate the system or aircraft; (2) use reasonable force to disable or destroy the system or aircraft; or (3) disrupt, alter, or intercept any communications to or from the system or aircraft. DOD may provide exceptions to such provisions.

The bill provides that: (1) DOD shall develop such actions with Department of Transportation assistance, consistent with the protection of sensitive defense information; and (2) any such system or aircraft shall be subject to U.S. seizure and forfeiture.

"Covered facility, asset, or classified information" means any facility, asset, or classified information that is: (1) so identified by DOD; (2) located in the United States or its territories and possessions; and (3) relating to DOD's missions of nuclear deterrence, missile defense, national space security, or homeland defense or other DOD missions involving vital security or infrastructure assets or information.</summary>
