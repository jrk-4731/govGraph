This bill requires the reinstatement of&#160;Medicaid&#160;benefits and Social Security disability benefits&#160;that were suspended due to a beneficiary's incarceration. Specifically,&#160;the bill requires:

 the post-release reinstatement of a beneficiary's Medicaid benefits without a requirement for the beneficiary to reapply; the post-release reinstatement of&#160;a beneficiary's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits without a requirement for the beneficiary to reapply, if the beneficiary received SSI benefits on the basis of blindness or disability; and the establishment of a system for a beneficiary who received Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits on the basis of disability to apply, prior to release,&#160;for the resumption of OASDI benefits.</summary>
