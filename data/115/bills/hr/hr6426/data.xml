This bill directs the Department of State to: (1) conduct a study on streamlining visa procedures for Russian students and persons involved in professional and cultural exchanges, and (2) enhance screening of certain senior Russian political figures and oligarchs and others associated with President Vladimir Putin.

The bill requires reports to Congress regarding: (1) efforts to strengthen strategic stability with Russia, (2) cultural exchange and educational programs with Russia, and (3) Russian proxies.

The Department of State shall convene a meeting of U.S. technology companies that sell or license tools that allow the Russian government to suppress civil society activists. The meeting shall focus on developing a code of conduct to restrain U.S. companies from aiding such efforts.

Additional funds are provided to increase the International Broadcasting Operations Fund's Russian language programming.

The State Department shall compile and make public a list of Russian-based persons who recruited or facilitated the transfer of Russian personnel for the Donbass war in Ukraine or the targeting of civilians in Syria. Such persons shall be prohibited from entering the United States.</summary>
