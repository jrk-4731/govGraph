This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit a nonimmigrant foreign exchange student to attend a U.S. public elementary, secondary, or a publicly funded adult education program for more than one year if such student pays the full unsubsidized tuition. (Under current law such students are limited to one year's attendance. Such restriction does not apply to private school students.)</summary>
