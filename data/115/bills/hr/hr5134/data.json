Additionally, it establishes an enhanced penalty for a criminal offense involving a false statement to a licensed gun dealer in connection with a firearm acquisition, if the false statement misrepresents the actual identify of a firearm purchaser.\n\nFinally, the bill directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to include, on the Firearms Transaction Record form, a statement outlining penalties for acting as the straw purchaser of a firearm."
