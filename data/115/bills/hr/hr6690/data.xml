(Sec. 2) This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish a pilot program that evaluates the feasibility of using smart card technology to address Medicare fraud. Under the program, smart card technology must be issued free-of-charge to selected Medicare beneficiaries, suppliers, and providers; such technology must support the secure, electronic authentication of beneficiary identity at points of service. In selecting program participants, the CMS must consider the risk of fraud, waste, or abuse among categories of suppliers and providers.</summary>
