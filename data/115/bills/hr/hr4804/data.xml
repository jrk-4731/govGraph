This bill authorizes an agency to waive medical standards or physical requirements applicable to a position occupied by a federal law enforcement officer if the officer suffers an injury: (1) that results in the officer's inability to meet the medical standards or physical requirements otherwise required for the position; and (2) that is not due to misconduct or willful negligence, or incurred during an unauthorized absence.

A law enforcement officer who receives a waiver is eligible for the retirement benefits that applied had the officer not suffered an injury.</summary>
