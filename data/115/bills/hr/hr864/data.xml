This bill amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to&#160;apply&#160;that Act's restrictions to&#160;collectors of debt owed to a federal agency.

A federal agency that is a creditor may not sell or transfer a debt to a debt collector until&#160;90 days after the obligation becomes delinquent or defaults. Specified notice to the consumer of such a sale or transfer is required.

A&#160;collector of debt owed to a federal agency may not collect any&#160;interest, fee, charge, or expense&#160;that is: (1) unreasonable in relation to&#160;actual costs, (2) not authorized by a contract between the debt collector and the federal agency,&#160;or (3) greater than 10% of the amount collected.

The Government Accountability Office shall study and report to Congress on&#160;the use of debt collectors by federal, state, and local government agencies.</summary>
