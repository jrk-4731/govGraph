  <summary date="2017-07-28T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Donations in Rough Years (DRY) Act 

This bill amends the Food Security Act of 1985, with respect to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), to permit hay that is harvested in the course of an activity that is authorized under CRP and complies with the program's requirements to be donated to the owners or operators of certain farms or ranches that are in disaster areas or are experiencing a drought.

(CRP provides payments to farmers who agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality.)

The hay may be donated to the owner or operator of a farm or ranch that is located in: (1) the state in which the hay is harvested, and (2) a county that is either experiencing a drought with a specified intensity or with respect to which the President has issued a declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act that a major disaster exists due to a fire.</summary>
