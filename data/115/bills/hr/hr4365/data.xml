This bill requires military departments to submit to the Department of Justice for inclusion in the national instant criminal background check system identifying information on each member of the Armed Forces who: (1) has been convicted of domestic violence offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or (2) has entered into a plea agreement accepting liability for such an offense.

The bill amends the federal criminal code to extend the prohibition on possession and transportation of firearms and ammunition by individuals convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence to individuals convicted of similar offenses under the UCMJ.</summary>
