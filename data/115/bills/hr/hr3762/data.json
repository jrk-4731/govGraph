The parties must coordinate with state insurance regulators. Congress has the power to review and disapprove by joint resolution any such agreement.\n\nThe bill amends the Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010 to modify requirements for a covered international agreement entered into by the Department of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office. Such an agreement must not include new prudential requirements for insurers and must only apply on a prospective basis. Congress has the power to review and disapprove by joint resolution any covered agreement."
