  <summary date="2017-07-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration a Disability Mobility Advisory Council. The council shall undertake information gathering activities, develop technical advice, and present best practices or recommendations to DOT regarding advancing mobility access for the disabled community with respect to the deployment of automated driving systems for motor vehicles to identify impediments to their use and ensure an awareness of the needs of such community as these highly automated vehicles are being designed for commercial distribution.

A "highly automated vehicle" is defined as a motor vehicle (excluding a commercial motor vehicle) equipped with an automated driving system.

An "automated driving system" is defined as the hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether such system is limited to a specific operational design domain.</summary>
