  <summary date="2017-11-03T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">VA Asset and Infrastructure Review Act of 2017

This bill establishes the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission, which shall make recommendations to the President regarding the closure, modernization, and/or realignment of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities based upon its own and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recommendations. The President shall transmit to the commission and to Congress a report containing the President's approval or disapproval of such recommendations by February 15, 2023. Within three years after transmittal of such report, the commission shall begin to implement the recommendations approved by the President and not disapproved by Congress.

The commission shall: (1) carry out appropriate environmental restoration and historic preservation in connection with facility closures or realignments, and (2) consult with state and local governments with respect to the treatment of roads or the disposal of surplus real property or infrastructure.

The VA may transfer the title of a VHA facility to the facility's redevelopment authority for lease to the VA or another federal agency.

The bill establishes in the Treasury the Department of Veterans Affairs Asset and Infrastructure Review Account.

The bill revises the definitions of: (1) "major medical facility project," and (2) "major medical facility lease."

The VA may enter into agreements with other federal agencies for the planning, designing, constructing, or leasing of shared medical facilities.

The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 is amended to exclude recruitment, relocation, or retention incentives from the limitation on awards and bonuses.

The bill provides funds for: (1) the Veterans Choice Program, and (2) medical facility minor construction and nonrecurring maintenance.</summary>
