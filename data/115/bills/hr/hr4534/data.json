DOT shall not release any funds until it certifies that the signatories have enacted such language.\n\nDOT may make grants to WMATA to finance the capital and preventive maintenance projects included in the Capital Improvement Program approved by WMATA's Board of Directors.\n\nThe bill sets forth protections for WMATA employees, including whistle-blower protections.\n\nThe General Services Administration shall initiate a review of the various transit benefit programs administered by each federal department and agency with facilities located in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Zone for purposes of standardizing the rate of benefit for all federal employees enrolled in such benefit programs.\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration shall conduct a review of its competitive grant programs.\n\nThe bill establishes a Metro Reform Commission to inform Congress and stakeholders on the progress of signatories in amending the WMATA compact and increasing efficiencies within WMATA. It also modifies standards for arbitrating disputes involving interstate compact agencies."
