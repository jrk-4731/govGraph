Prior to submitting a PSDAR, a licensee must consult with affected states and localities.\n\nIn the state where the nuclear facility is located, the NRC is required to: (1) solicit public comments on a proposed PSDAR; (2) conduct at least two public hearings; and (3) invite the state to file a statement of support, nonsupport, or conditional support for the proposed PSDAR with specific recommendations that could lead to support.\n\nThe NRC must determine the adequacy or inadequacy of a proposed PSDAR and issue a decision document accordingly."
