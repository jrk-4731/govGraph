A \"fusion center\" is a collaborative effort of two or more agencies that provide resources, expertise and information to the center with the goal of maximizing their ability to detect, prevent, investigate, and respond to criminal and terrorist activity.\n\nDHS shall (1) establish a working group to promote collaborative engagement between DHS and stakeholders to develop non-binding recommendations for enhancing security in public areas of transportation facilities, and (2) disseminate best practices to enhance security against the threat of a vehicle-based terrorist attack."
