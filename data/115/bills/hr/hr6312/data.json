The deduction applies to amounts paid for: (1) fitness facility memberships, (2) physical exercise or activity programs, and (3) safety equipment for use in a physical exercise or activity program.\n\nThe overall deduction is limited to $500 per year (twice the amount in the case of a joint return or a head of household), and a deduction for safety equipment may not exceed $250. The bill requires the limits to be adjusted for inflation after 2019.\n\nThe deduction does not include expenses for golf, hunting, sailing, horseback riding, and videos or books."
