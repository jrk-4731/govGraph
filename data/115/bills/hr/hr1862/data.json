The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nGlobal Child Protection Act of 2017\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal criminal code to broaden the definition of \"illicit sexual conduct\" to include any conduct involving a minor (currently, a sexual act with a minor) that would be a sex abuse offense if it occurs inside the United States. A minor is a person under 18 years of age.\n\n(Sec. 3) Additionally, the bill broadens the federal sex offenses that trigger a mandatory life prison term for a defendant with a prior sex offense conviction involving a minor victim. Specifically, it adds to the list of federal sex offenses:\n\n abusive sexual contact that constitutes either a sexual act with a person under the age of 12 or aggravated sexual abuse of a person between the ages of 12 and 16, and illicit sexual conduct during foreign travel."
