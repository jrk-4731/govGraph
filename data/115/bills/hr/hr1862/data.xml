Global Child Protection Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal criminal code to broaden the definition of "illicit sexual conduct" to include any conduct involving a minor (currently, a sexual act with a minor) that would be a sex abuse offense if it occurs inside the United States. A minor is a person under 18 years of age.

(Sec. 3) Additionally, the bill broadens the federal sex offenses that trigger a mandatory life prison term for a defendant with a prior sex offense conviction involving a minor victim. Specifically, it adds to the list of federal sex offenses:

 abusive sexual contact that constitutes either a sexual act with a person under the age of 12 or aggravated sexual abuse of a person between the ages of 12 and 16, and illicit sexual conduct during foreign travel.</summary>
