  <summary date="2018-04-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Emergency Port of Entry Personnel and Infrastructure Funding Act of 2018

This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to hire, train, and assign to duty, by September 30, 2023: (1) 5,000 additional full-time U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers to serve on all inspection lanes and enforcement teams at U.S. land ports of entry on the northern and southern borders, and (2) 350 full-time support staff for all U.S. ports of entry.

The bill also requires DHS to:

 ensure that each CBP officer is equipped with a secure two-way communication and satellite-enabled device that allows communication between ports of entry and inspection stations and with other law enforcement entities; award grants for the purchase of identification and detection equipment and mobile, hand-held, two-way communication devices for state and local law enforcement officers serving on the southern border; develop a strategic plan for standardized collection of vehicle wait times at land ports of entry and update it to reflect new practices, time lines, tools, and assessments; develop a standardized model for the allocation of CBP officers and support staff at land ports of entry; and identify and adopt at least two new, outcome-based performance measures that support the trade facilitation goals of the CBP.</summary>
