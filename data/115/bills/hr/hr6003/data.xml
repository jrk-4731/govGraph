This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for enhanced penalties for the transmission of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to trigger an emergency response by: (1) a law enforcement agency of the United States, a state, or a political subdivision of a state; (2) an agency of the United States, a state, or a political subdivision of a state, or a private not-for-profit organization, that provides fire, rescue, or emergency medical services; or (3) a public safety answering point (a facility that has been designated to receive emergency calls and route them to emergency service personnel).

The court shall order a defendant who has been convicted of such an offense to reimburse any such entity for expenses incurred in responding to such conduct. The bill treats such an order of reimbursement as a civil judgment.</summary>
