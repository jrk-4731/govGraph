This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to modify standards and payment for&#160;air-ambulance services under the Medicare Program.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)&#160;shall establish minimum standards that must be met by air-ambulance suppliers and providers as a condition of their participation in Medicare. These standards must address: (1) scope of practice, training, and clinical capability; (2) medical equipment and vehicle attributes; (3) documentation; (4) medical direction and oversight; (5) reporting of&#160;specified events; (6) patient safety and infection control; (7) clinical quality-management and performance-improvement programs; and (8) particular populations. An air-ambulance provider or supplier that is accredited by an HHS-approved organization shall be deemed to be in compliance with these standards.

HHS must establish an air-ambulance quality-reporting and performance program under which Medicare payment is determined according to a specified performance-based formula. Performance measures shall address patient safety, clinical quality, and over-triage.

An air-ambulance provider or supplier must, subject to suspension of&#160;payment under Medicare,&#160;annually&#160;submit specified cost data to HHS.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission shall report to Congress on whether changes should be made with regard to reimbursement of air-ambulance providers and suppliers under Medicare.</summary>
