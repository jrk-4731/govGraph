 extend the Independence at Home demonstration program; modify&#160;provisions regarding access to home dialysis therapy under Medicare and special needs plans under Medicare Advantage (MA); expand testing of the MA Value-Based Insurance Design test model; allow an MA plan to provide additional telehealth benefits to enrollees and, to chronically ill enrollees, certain supplemental health care&#160;benefits; modify other provisions regarding the use of telehealth services; allow prospective, voluntary&#160;assignment of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to accountable care organizations (ACOs); allow ACOs to operate beneficiary incentive programs; require the Centers for Medicare &amp;&#160;Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish a process for Medicare prescription-drug plan sponsors to request certain claims data from the CMS; require the CMS to study and report to Congress on long-term risk factors for chronic conditions among Medicare beneficiaries; and eliminate annual funding available to the Medicare Improvement Fund and the Medicaid Improvement Fund beginning in FY2021. The Government Accountability Office shall conduct studies on:
