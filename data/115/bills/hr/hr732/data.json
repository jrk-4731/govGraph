The bill provides exceptions to allow payments or loans that: (1) remedy actual harm (including to the environment) caused by the party making the payment or loan and suffered by the payee, or (2) constitute a payment for services rendered in connection with the case or a payment that a court may order for restitution to victims in certain criminal cases or other persons in plea agreements.\n\nAmounts remaining after all claims have been satisfied must be repaid proportionally to each party who contributed to the original payment.\n\nGovernment officials or agents who violate this prohibition may be removed from office or required to forfeit to the government any money they hold for such purposes to which they may otherwise be entitled.\n\nFederal agencies must report annually for seven years to the Congressional Budget Office about the parties, funding sources, and distribution of funds for their settlement agreements permitted by the exceptions in this bill.\n\nAgency inspectors general must report annually to Congress about any of their agency's settlement agreements that violate this bill."
