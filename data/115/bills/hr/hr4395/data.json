The National Spatial Data Infrastructure (as defined in this bill) shall ensure that geospatial data from multiple sources is available and easily integrated to enhance the understanding of the physical and cultural world.\n\nThe committee shall: (1) prepare a strategic plan for the implementation of the infrastructure consistent with national security, national defense, and emergency preparedness program policies regarding data accessibility; and (2) designate, and establish standards for, National Geospatial Data Asset core geospatial datasets for primary topics for which the coordinated development, maintenance, and dissemination of geospatial data will benefit the government and people of the United States.\n\n The committee shall operate GeoPlatform, an electronic service that provides access to geospatial data and metadata for geospatial data.\n\n Agencies whose functions involve geospatial data shall implement a strategy for advancing geographic information and related geospatial data activities appropriate to that agency's mission in support of the strategic plan for the infrastructure. Such agencies shall disclose each contract, cooperative agreement, grant, or other transaction that deals with geospatial data.\n\n Five years after enactment of this bill, federal funding shall not be made available for the collection, production, acquisition, maintenance, or dissemination of geospatial data that does not comply with applicable standards established by the committee."
