  <summary date="2017-06-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Aviation Funding Stability Act

This bill requires that, beginning October 1, 2017, receipts and disbursements of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund shall not be subject to: (1) any sequestration order; (2) apportionment; (3) appropriation; and (4) any legal requirement, directive, or other provision of law of or related to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The bill authorizes funding for the Federal Aviation Administration Operations account. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall be exempt from any order or other requirement of the OMB.

The Federal Aviation Management Advisory Council shall assess the performance of the air traffic control system and the FAA's policy and strategic decisions regarding the system's operation and modernization, and make recommendations.

In any fiscal year between 2018 and 2030, there is authorized to be appropriated from the trust fund such sums as necessary to bring any air traffic control facility of the FAA into acceptable condition.

 The FAA shall: (1) develop and implement a revised system governing all of its acquisitions, including incorporating private-sector best practices for major capital investments in information technology and telecommunications; (2) make changes to its personnel management system to improve the productivity, cost effectiveness, and technical proficiency of that part of its workforce not represented by a labor organization; (3) jointly develop a staffing standard with the exclusive bargaining representative of air traffic controllers; and (4) develop internal policies and procedures to organize personnel assignments in a manner that facilitates open communication and collaboration.</summary>
