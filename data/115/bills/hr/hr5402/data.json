The standards and performance plans shall be: (1) based on customer and market research that identifies the aspects of service delivery that are most important to citizens, and (2) collected through both qualitative and quantitative research methods that incorporate voluntary feedback from citizens. The approved standards and performance plans shall be included in the agency performance plans.\n\nThe OMB shall establish the Service Improvement and Accountability Unit Pilot Program to provide assistance to an agency that does not meet applicable customer experience standards."
