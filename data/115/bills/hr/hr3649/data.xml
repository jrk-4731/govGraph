  <summary date="2017-08-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Fair CRP Payments Act 

This bill amends the Food Security Act of 1985, with respect to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), to require the Department of Agriculture to conduct surveys of rental rates on an annual basis, instead of the existing requirement to conduct the surveys at least once every other year.

(The surveys are a factor used to determine CRP rental payments and include per acre estimates of county average market dryland and irrigated cash rental rates for cropland and pastureland in all counties or equivalent subdivisions within each state that have 20,000 acres or more of cropland and pastureland.)</summary>
