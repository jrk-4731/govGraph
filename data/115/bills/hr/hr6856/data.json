Specifically, the bill extends through FY2023\u00a0provisions that:\n\n require the Inspectors General of the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, jointly with the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Agency for International Development,\u00a0to coordinate and conduct oversight of PEPFAR programs; limit\u00a0U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to 33% of funds contributed from all sources; require that certain\u00a0fund contributions be withheld under specified circumstances, such as if funds were used to assist a country that has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism; and require that more than half of the PEPFAR budget be allocated\u00a0for specified\u00a0HIV/AIDS treatment and care. The bill also extends through FY2024 annual reporting requirements relating to HIV/AIDS treatment providers and costs."
