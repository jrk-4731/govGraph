  <summary date="2017-11-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill amends the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978 to increase the maximum cost-share payment permitted under the Department of Agriculture Emergency Conservation Program (ECP).

(The ECP provides emergency funding and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters and to implement emergency water conservation measures in periods of severe drought.)

The bill requires the maximum cost-share payment permitted under the ECP (currently $200,000 per person or legal entity, per natural disaster) to be equal to the maximum cost-share permitted under the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (currently $500,000 per person or legal entity, per disaster).</summary>
