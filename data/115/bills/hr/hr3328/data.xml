Cuban Airport Security Act of 2017

This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to brief Congress and the Government Accountability Office on specified aspects of security measures at each of Cuba's 10 international airports

No U.S. air carrier that has entered into a covered agreement may employ a Cuban national beginning 30 days after enactment of this bill unless such carrier has publicly disclosed the full text of the agreement, and such nationals shall not have been recruited, hired, or trained by entities that are owned, operated, or controlled by Cuba's Council of State, Council of Ministers, Communist Party, Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or Ministry of the Interior.

A "covered agreement" means a formal agreement between a U.S. air carrier with passenger air service between any location in Cuba and any location in the United States and the Empresa Cubana de Aeropuertos y Servicios Aeronauticos or any other entity associated with the Cuban government.

(Sec. 3) TSA shall develop a standard working document for all negotiations and agreements between the United States and foreign governments or partners regarding Federal Air Marshal coverage of flights to and from the United States. All such agreements shall be written and signed by the DHS Secretary. DHS shall notify Congress of any such agreement within 30 days of it being signed.

(Sec. 4) The U.S. Ambassador or the Charge d'Affaires to the U.S. Mission to the International Civil Aviation Organization shall pursue improvements to airport security, including introducing a resolution to raise minimum airport security standards.</summary>
