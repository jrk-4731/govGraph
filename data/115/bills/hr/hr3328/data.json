All such agreements shall be written and signed by the DHS Secretary. DHS shall notify Congress of any such agreement within 30 days of it being signed.\n\n(Sec. 4) The U.S. Ambassador or the Charge d'Affaires to the U.S. Mission to the International Civil Aviation Organization shall pursue improvements to airport security, including introducing a resolution to raise minimum airport security standards."
