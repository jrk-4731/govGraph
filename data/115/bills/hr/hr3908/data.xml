This bill authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to eligible entities for the purpose of preventing or alleviating the effects of community violence by providing education, mentoring, and counseling&#160;related to&#160;principles of nonviolence in conflict resolution. "Eligible entities" include state or local government entities, educational institutions, nonprofit communities, and faith-based organizations.

In awarding grants under the program, DOJ shall give priority to applicants that agree to use the grant funds&#160;in at least one&#160;community that can certify: (1) an increased or sustained level of violence or tension in the community; or (2) a lack of resources to adopt innovative, integrated, community-based violence prevention programs.</summary>
