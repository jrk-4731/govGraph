  <summary date="2017-01-12T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Subsidy Reserve Act of 2017

This bill amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve&#160;Board (FRB)&#160;and each bank holding company with total consolidated assets of at least $500 billion to establish and maintain a capital&#160;account called a "subsidy reserve." The amount in a company's subsidy reserve shall be based, according to a formula established by the FRB, on the financial benefit received by the company as a result of the expectation of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties that the federal government will shield them from losses in the event of the company's failure. The amount in a company's subsidy reserve may be taken into account&#160;for purposes of determining a company's compliance with&#160;regulatory capital requirements.</summary>
