The section also requires specified adjustments to the annual discretionary spending limits for FY2020-FY2027 to accommodate additional funding for wildfire suppression operations in the Wildland Fire Management accounts at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Department of the Interior.

(Sec. 103) Interior or USDA, as appropriate, shall submit to Congress a request for supplemental appropriations if the amount provided for wildfire suppression operations for a fiscal year will be exhausted within 30 days.

TITLE II--FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

(Sec. 202) This section amends the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to authorize certain hazardous fuels reduction projects for wildfire resilience. The section also: (1) categorically excludes the projects from requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to produce environmental assessments or environmental impact statements, and (2) exempts the projects from the special administrative review process under the Act.

The projects must carry out forest restoration treatments that:

 maximize the retention of old-growth and large trees to the extent that they promote stands that are resilient to insects and disease and reduce the risk or extent of, or increase resilience to, wildfires; consider the best available scientific information to maintain or restore ecological integrity; and are developed and implemented through a collaborative process that meets specified requirements. A project under this section may carry out part of a proposal that complies with the eligibility requirements of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program under the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.

The section prohibits a project under this section from exceeding 3,000 acres.

A project under this section shall be:

 prioritized within the wildland-urban interface; if located outside the interface, limited to areas within Condition Classes 2 or 3 in Fire Regime Groups I, II, or III that contain very high wildfire hazard potential; and limited to landscape-scale areas in national forests that are experiencing an insect or disease epidemic and that have been designated as treatment areas under the Act as of this bill's enactment. The section prohibits a project under this section from including the establishment of any permanent roads.

USDA and Interior may carry out necessary maintenance and repairs on existing permanent roads for the purposes of this section.

USDA and Interior shall decommission any temporary road constructed for a project under this section within three years of the completion of that project.

Whenever using the categorical exclusion under this section, USDA and Interior must apply the extraordinary circumstances procedures relating to the categorical exclusion of certain types of proposed actions from further analysis and documentation in an Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment under the NEPA if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action.

This section does not apply to:

 components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, federal land on which the removal of vegetation is restricted or prohibited, congressionally designated wilderness study areas, or an area in which the activities would be inconsistent with the applicable land and resource management plan. All projects and activities carried out under this section must be consistent with the land and resource management plan established under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 for the National Forest Service (NFS) unit containing the applicable projects and activities.

USDA and Interior shall conduct public notice and scoping for any projects or actions proposed in accordance with this section.

USDA and Interior shall submit to Congress and the Government Accountability Office annual reports on the use of categorical exclusions under this section.

(Sec. 203) This section expands the definition for an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project to include the installation of:

 a natural or manmade change in fuel characteristics that affects fire behavior such that a fire can be more readily controlled (commonly known as a fuel break), and a natural or constructed barrier used to stop or check a fire or to provide a control line from which to work to stop or check a fire (commonly known as a firebreak). (Sec. 204) This section authorizes the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to obligate funds in stages that are economically or programmatically viable to cover any potential cancellation ceiling or termination costs with respect to an agreement or contract for a stewardship end result contracting project.

The Forest Service and BLM must notify Congress 30 days before entering into a multiyear agreement or contract that includes a cancellation ceiling exceeding $25 million if proposed funding for the costs of cancelling the agreement or contract up to the ceiling is not included. The Forest Service and the BLM shall also transmit a copy of such a notice to the Office of Management and Budget.

(Sec. 205) If the offset value of the forest products to be removed under stewardship contracts exceeds the value of the resource improvement treatments, the Forest Service and BLM may: (1) use the excess to satisfy any outstanding liabilities for cancelled agreements or contracts; or (2) if there are no such outstanding liabilities, apply the excess to other authorized stewardship projects.

(Sec. 206) This section requires annual reports on the status of the development, implementation, and administration of agreements or contracts for authorized stewardship projects to be submitted to specified congressional committees.

(Sec. 207) USDA and Interior may award contracts or agreements to enter into authorized stewardship projects for terms of up to 20 years on areas where the majority of federal lands are located in Fire Regime Groups I, II, or III.

In awarding such a contract, USDA and Interior may give a procurement preference to a contractor that would promote an innovative use of forest products, including cross-laminated timber, as part of such contract.

(Sec. 208) This section specifies that the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or the designation of critical habitat pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) does not require USDA to engage in certain additional consultations to update or revise an approved land and resource management plan unless: (1) 15 years have passed since USDA adopted such a plan; and (2) 5 years have passed since the later of this section's enactment, the listing of a species as threatened or endangered for a species known to occur on a unit, or the designation of critical habitat within such unit.

(Sec. 209) This section prohibits the BLM from being required to engage in consultation under any law concerning the Oregon and California Railroad revested grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands, with respect to: (1) the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or a designation of a critical habitat, if a land use plan has already been adopted; and (2) any provision of such plan. (Sec. 210) The Forest Service shall:

 publish a geospatial map appropriate for community-level use that depicts wildfire hazard severity to inform at-risk communities that are adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire, and disseminate such information in a web-based format. The section states that the purposes of such map are to:

 inform evaluations of wildfire risk, prioritize fuels management needs, and depict the relative potential for wildfire that could be difficult for suppression resources to contain and that could cause ignitions to structures. (Sec. 211) Interior and USDA must issue and periodically update guidance to ensure that provisions are developed and implemented for utility vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance of rights-of-way for electricity transmission and distribution facilities.

Such guidance must be compatible with the mandatory reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability Organization (the organization) and take into account a specified memorandum of understanding on vegetation management for powerline rights-of-way.

Also, such guidance shall:

 be developed in consultation with the owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities that hold rights-of-way; seek to minimize the need for case-by-case approvals for routine vegetation management activities, facility inspections, operation and maintenance activities, and utility vegetation management activities necessary to control hazard trees; and provide for prompt and timely review of requests to conduct vegetation management activities that require approval by Interior or USDA, as appropriate, especially those that require expedited or immediate action. Interior and USDA shall give facility owners and operators the option to submit a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan that meets specified requirements.

Owners and operators subject to mandatory reliability standards established by the organization (or superseding standards) may use them as part of their plans.

Interior and USDA shall develop jointly a consolidated and coordinated process for review and approval of these plans.

Interior and USDA shall identify, with respect to the development and approval of such plans, as well as with respect to the actions carried out under them, categories of actions for which neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment shall be required under federal regulations relating to categorical exclusions under NEPA.

An owner or operator of a facility that is not subject to the mandatory reliability standards established by the organization or that has sold less than or equal to 1 million megawatt hours of electric energy for purposes other than resale during each of the three years immediately preceding this section's enactment may enter into an agreement with Interior or USDA, as appropriate, instead of a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan.

If vegetation or hazard trees have contacted or present an imminent danger of contacting an electric transmission or distribution line from within or adjacent to an electric transmission or distribution right-of-way, the owner or operator of such lines:

 may prune or remove the vegetation or hazard tree to avoid the disruption of electric service and to eliminate immediate fire and safety hazards, and shall notify USDA or Interior no later than one day after the response to the emergency conditions. The owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility may conduct vegetation management activities that require the approval of Interior or USDA, as appropriate, in accordance with a plan approved or an agreement entered into pursuant to this section, but only after receiving the approval of such department.
