The Forest Service and the BLM shall also transmit a copy of such a notice to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n(Sec. 205) If the offset value of the forest products to be removed under stewardship contracts exceeds the value of the resource improvement treatments, the Forest Service and BLM may: (1) use the excess to satisfy any outstanding liabilities for cancelled agreements or contracts; or (2) if there are no such outstanding liabilities, apply the excess to other authorized stewardship projects.\n\n(Sec. 206) This section requires annual reports on the status of the development, implementation, and administration of agreements or contracts for authorized stewardship projects to be submitted to specified congressional committees.\n\n(Sec. 207) USDA and Interior may award contracts or agreements to enter into authorized stewardship projects for terms of up to 20 years on areas where the majority of federal lands are located in Fire Regime Groups I, II, or III.\n\nIn awarding such a contract, USDA and Interior may give a procurement preference to a contractor that would promote an innovative use of forest products, including cross-laminated timber, as part of such contract.\n\n(Sec. 208) This section specifies that the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or the designation of critical habitat pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) does not require USDA to engage in certain additional consultations to update or revise an approved land and resource management plan unless: (1) 15 years have passed since USDA adopted such a plan; and (2) 5 years have passed since the later of this section's enactment, the listing of a species as threatened or endangered for a species known to occur on a unit, or the designation of critical habitat within such unit.\n\n(Sec. 209) This section prohibits the BLM from being required to engage in consultation under any law concerning the Oregon and California Railroad revested grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands, with respect to: (1) the listing of a species as threatened or endangered or a designation of a critical habitat, if a land use plan has already been adopted; and (2) any provision of such plan. (Sec. 210) The Forest Service shall:\n\n publish a geospatial map appropriate for community-level use that depicts wildfire hazard severity to inform at-risk communities that are adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire, and disseminate such information in a web-based format.

Interior and USDA shall give facility owners and operators the option to submit a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan that meets specified requirements.\n\nOwners and operators subject to mandatory reliability standards established by the organization (or superseding standards) may use them as part of their plans.\n\nInterior and USDA shall develop jointly a consolidated and coordinated process for review and approval of these plans.\n\nInterior and USDA shall identify, with respect to the development and approval of such plans, as well as with respect to the actions carried out under them, categories of actions for which neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment shall be required under federal regulations relating to categorical exclusions under NEPA.\n\nAn owner or operator of a facility that is not subject to the mandatory reliability standards established by the organization or that has sold less than or equal to 1 million megawatt hours of electric energy for purposes other than resale during each of the three years immediately preceding this section's enactment may enter into an agreement with Interior or USDA, as appropriate, instead of a vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan.\n\nIf vegetation or hazard trees have contacted or present an imminent danger of contacting an electric transmission or distribution line from within or adjacent to an electric transmission or distribution right-of-way, the owner or operator of such lines:\n\n may prune or remove the vegetation or hazard tree to avoid the disruption of electric service and to eliminate immediate fire and safety hazards, and shall notify USDA or Interior no later than one day after the response to the emergency conditions. The owner or operator of a transmission or distribution facility may conduct vegetation management activities that require the approval of Interior or USDA, as appropriate, in accordance with a plan approved or an agreement entered into pursuant to this section, but only after receiving the approval of such department.\n\nNonetheless, the owner or operator of such a facility may conduct such activities in accordance with such a plan or agreement without first getting approval if:\n\n the owner or operator submitted a request to USDA or Interior, as appropriate, in accordance with the applicable schedule; the activities, including the removal of hazard trees, proposed in the request are in accordance with the plan or agreement; and such department failed to respond to the request in accordance with the schedule. Interior and USDA shall not impose strict liability for damages or injury that results from Interior or USDA unreasonably: (1) withholding or delaying approval of a plan or an agreement, or (2) failing to adhere to a schedule in such a plan or agreement.\n\nFor the period ending 10 years after the enactment of this section, Interior and USDA shall not impose strict liability amounting to more than $500,000 per incident for damages or injury that result from activities conducted by an owner or operator in accordance with an approved agreement.\n\nInterior and USDA shall report annually on their respective websites all such requests and actions made concerning vegetation management activities that require approval.\n\nInterior and USDA shall report to Congress on the effect on the Treasury of the strict liability limitation established by this section.\n\nInterior and USDA are encouraged to develop a program for training personnel of Interior and Forest Service, respectively, involved in vegetation management decisions related to electric transmission and distribution facilities.\n\n(Sec. 212) This section amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to include under the definition of \"forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration services,\" with respect to good neighbor agreements, the reconstruction, repair, restoration, or decommissioning of certain NFS roads as necessary to carry out authorized forest restoration services under a good neighbor agreement..\n\nTITLE III--FEDERAL LAND TRANSACTION FACILITATION REAUTHORIZATION\n\nFederal Land Transaction Facilitation Act Reauthorization of 2018\n\nThis title permanently reauthorizes and amends the authority included in the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA), which provides for the sale or exchange of certain Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land that has been identified for disposal under BLM land use plans.\n\n(Sec. 302) This section makes several amendments to the FLTFA.
