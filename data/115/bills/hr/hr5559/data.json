FEMA must transfer such functions by 18 months after enactment of this bill.\n\nThe bill changes the membership composition of the Technical Mapping Advisory Council.\n\nThe bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act to direct the USGS to charge policy holders a fee for the purpose of recovering the cost of mapping activities. FEMA shall deposit the fees collected into a Flood Insurance Risk Mapping Fund which shall be available to the USGS for mapping activities."
