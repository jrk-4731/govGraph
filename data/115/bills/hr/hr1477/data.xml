  <summary date="2017-03-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act

This bill prohibits: (1) any federal agency from obligating or expending any federal funds to carry out provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 regarding barriers at the border or any related provision of law or to otherwise build a border fence, wall, or related physical barriers along the U.S. southern border; and (2) a state from using federal grant funds for such purpose.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must conduct an audit each fiscal year to assess compliance with such prohibition. If the GAO is unable to confirm compliance, the Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies must take specified actions to reduce funds for federal agencies and states until the GAO is able to confirm compliance.

The bill authorizes the President to enter into a treaty, approved by the Senate, with a foreign country to pay for the costs associated with carrying out such border barrier activities. The Inspector General of the federal agency responsible for carrying out such treaty shall oversee the use of funds received and expended pursuant to such treaty.

The OMB shall: (1) include a statement of budgetary impact of and related to any executive order or presidential memorandum issued relating to border security during FY2017-FY2021; and (2) establish a publicly available website to track and display funds received from other non-federal sources, including foreign governments, to build a barrier along the souther border.</summary>
