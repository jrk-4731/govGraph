After the lands are taken into trust, they must be treated as part of the community's reservation.\n\nGaming is prohibited on the land taken into trust.\n\n(Sec. 5) The bill establishes a fixed, permanent boundary for the reservation's northern boundary.\n\n(Sec. 6) The benefits realized by the community, its members, and allottees under this bill satisfy their claims against the United States in connection with alleged failures relating to: (1) establishing and documenting federal rights-of-way on the reservation; and (2) establishing, maintaining, and defending the northern boundary.\n\n(Sec. 7) The bill establishes, ratifies, documents, and confirms federal rights-of-way and easements within the reservation.\n\n(Sec. 8) Within six years, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) must publish a survey of each of the federal rights-of-way established under this bill.
