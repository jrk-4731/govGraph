  <summary date="2018-12-22T04:59:58Z" status="Public Law">Gila River Indian Community Federal Rights-of-Way, Easements and Boundary Clarification Act

(Sec. 4) This bill directs the Department of the Interior to take into trust 3,400 acres of land in Arizona, known as the Lower Sonoran Lands, for the benefit of the Gila River Indian Community, a government composed of members of the Pima Tribe and the Maricopa Tribe. After the lands are taken into trust, they must be treated as part of the community's reservation.

Gaming is prohibited on the land taken into trust.

(Sec. 5) The bill establishes a fixed, permanent boundary for the reservation's northern boundary.

(Sec. 6) The benefits realized by the community, its members, and allottees under this bill satisfy their claims against the United States in connection with alleged failures relating to: (1) establishing and documenting federal rights-of-way on the reservation; and (2) establishing, maintaining, and defending the northern boundary.

(Sec. 7) The bill establishes, ratifies, documents, and confirms federal rights-of-way and easements within the reservation.

(Sec. 8) Within six years, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) must publish a survey of each of the federal rights-of-way established under this bill. Upon completion of the surveys, the community and BIA may remove a federal right-of-way.</summary>
