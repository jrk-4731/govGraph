(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to expand the responsibilities of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to ensure that the center's activities address the security of both information and operational technology, including industrial control systems.

Additionally, the center must maintain capabilities to identify and address threats and vulnerabilities to products and technologies intended for use in the automated control of critical infrastructure processes by: (1) leading efforts to mitigate cybersecurity threats to industrial control systems; (2) maintaining cross-sector incident response capabilities to respond to cybersecurity incidents; (3) providing cybersecurity technical assistance to stakeholders; and (4) collecting, coordinating, and providing vulnerability information to the industrial control systems community.

The center shall provide to the homeland security committees a briefing on its industrial control systems capabilities at specified intervals.</summary>
