This bill amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to apply nutritional standards for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to foods purchased for the USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program).

Under current law, foods purchased for WIC must: (1) contain nutrients determined by nutritional research to be lacking in the diets of pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, or children; or (2) promote the health of the population served by the program.</summary>
