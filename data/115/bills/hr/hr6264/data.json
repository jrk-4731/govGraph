    "text": "Restoring America's Leadership in Innovation Act of 2018\n\nThis bill revises several parts of the patent law.\n\nThe bill changes the U.S. patent system back to a first-to-invent system, where the first inventor to conceive of an invention is entitled to a patent. Currently, the first person to file an application that meets all the requirements is entitled to the patent, as a result of the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.\n\nSeveral types of administrative patent challenge proceedings are abolished, as well as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office body that decides those proceedings.\n\nThis bill relaxes the standard of what constitutes patent-eligible subject matter. The only ineligible inventions shall be those that exist in nature independent or prior to human activity, or exist solely in the human mind.\n\nThis bill limits what types of publications shall be treated as prior art that could be used to make an invention anticipated or obvious.\n\nThis bill authorizes the USPTO to keep and spend all the fees that it collects."
