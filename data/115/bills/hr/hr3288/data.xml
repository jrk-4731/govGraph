  <summary date="2017-07-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Northern Border Regional Commission Reauthorization Act of 2017

This bill provides that the share of the administrative expenses of the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission, or the Northern Border Regional Commission to be paid by each state of such commission shall be determined by a majority (currently, unanimous) vote of the state members of such commission.

A commission must include in the 40% of any economic and infrastructure development grant amounts provided to states or local governments, Indian tribes, or public or nonprofit organizations for the development of the transportation infrastructure, basic public infrastructure, or telecommunications infrastructure amounts for the development of renewable and alternative energy sources in its region.

Such economic and infrastructure development grants may be used to attract businesses to a region from outside of the United States.

The bill reauthorizes each commission through FY2023.</summary>
