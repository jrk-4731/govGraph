This bill directs the Government Accountability Office to submit to Congress a review of the authorization, funding, management, and operation of the National Targeting Center (NTC) established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) established under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6.

 Such review shall include: (1) identification of any weaknesses or gaps in coordination, and of any unnecessarily duplicative or overlapping efforts, between the NTC and the TSC; (2) recommendations on how the NTC and the TSC may better support and complement one another; (3) a cost-benefit analysis of congressional authorization of the TSC; and (4) an assessment of the protocols within the NTC and the TSC on how to receive and utilize information provided by federal departments and agencies.</summary>
