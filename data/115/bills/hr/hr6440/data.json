(TEACH grants support teachers who have expertise in high-need\u00a0subjects or\u00a0teach in schools serving students from low-income families.)\n\nIn selecting teacher candidates for these grants, the Department of Education (ED) shall give priority to applicants who are members of a group that is underrepresented in teaching subjects related to science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM),\u00a0or computer science.\n\nThe bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to:\u00a0(1)\u00a0provide a specified funding level for the STEM master teacher corps program, and (2) require a STEM master teacher corps to establish and consult\u00a0with a private-sector advisory board that meets specified requirements."
