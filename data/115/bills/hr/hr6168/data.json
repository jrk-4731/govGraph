An \"aviation-impacted community\" is a community that is located not more than one mile from any point at which a commercial or cargo jet route is 3,000 feet or less above ground level.\n\nThe FAA must devise an action plan that alleviates or addresses the concerns of a designated community. It may also make grants for necessary noise mitigation in a designated community for residences, hospitals, nursing homes, and schools."
