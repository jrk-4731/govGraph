This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct outreach to community leaders of aviation-impacted communities to inform them of the opportunity to be a designated community. An "aviation-impacted community" is a community that is located not more than one mile from any point at which a commercial or cargo jet route is 3,000 feet or less above ground level.

The FAA must devise an action plan that alleviates or addresses the concerns of a designated community. It may also make grants for necessary noise mitigation in a designated community for residences, hospitals, nursing homes, and schools.</summary>
