  <summary date="2017-04-06T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Demonstration of Coverage for Low Vision Devices Act of 2017

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to&#160;carry out&#160;a demonstration project to evaluate the fiscal impact of covering low-vision devices under Medicare in the same manner as Medicare coverage is provided for durable medical equipment. "Low-vision device" means a physician-prescribed device that magnifies, enhances, or otherwise augments or interprets visual images; the term does not include ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses.

 The bill appropriates $2.5 million&#160;for FY2018 and each of the next four fiscal&#160;years for the CMS to carry out the project.</summary>
