  <summary date="2017-05-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">SBIR Commercialization Assistance Act of 2017

This bill amends the Small Business Act to require a federal agency required to have a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program (covered agency) to implement a commercialization assistance pilot program (CAPP), under which an eligible entity may received a subsequent Phase II SBIR award through FY2022, unless the Small Business Administration determines that the agency already has a program sufficiently similar to a CAPP.

An eligible entity is a small business concern that has received a Phase II award under an SBIR program and an additional Phase II SBIR award from the covered agency to which such small business concern is applying for the subsequent award.

The Government Accountability Office must evaluate and report to Congress on CAPP, including a summary of activities and results and recommendations for CAPP improvement.</summary>
