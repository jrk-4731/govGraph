 This bill directs the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to establish the Global Autism Assistance Program to: (1) support activities by nongovernmental organizations and other service providers focused on autism in developing countries, and (2) establish a "teach the teachers" program to train health and education professionals working with such children.

 The President may provide assistance to support a network of trained medical practitioners to treat hydrocephalus in children at pediatric hospitals and hydrocephalus treatment centers in developing countries. Such assistance shall provide for surgeon training and establishment of at least 20 treatment centers.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall negotiate with the World Health Organization to develop the Global Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Action Plan and establish a related Global Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Fund.

 The President shall appoint a high-level official to lead federal efforts to develop the plan and the fund and facilitate partnerships to identify new treatment approaches for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

 HHS shall investigate the foreign aid implications of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.</summary>
