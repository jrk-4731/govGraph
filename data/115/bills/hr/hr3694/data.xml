This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to: (1) seek to enter into an agreement with a federally funded research and development center to assess requirements for cooperative threat reduction, and (2) provide such center with access to necessary information and resources.

The center shall provide DOD with an interim and a final report that shall include: (1) a discussion of the requirements and capabilities necessary for reducing the threats of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; (2) identification of capability gaps for cooperative threat reduction efforts; (3) recommendations for actions to modernize the DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program; and (4) recommendations to modernize the command and control enterprise and the role of the Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, with respect to foreign countries, is intended to facilitate the elimination and the safe and secure transportation and storage of nuclear, chemical, biological, or other weapons and prevent their proliferation.</summary>
