This bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)to establish a joint program office within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations to coordinate the acquisition and assessment of unmanned maritime systems.

NOAA must coordinate with the Department of the Navy to leverage expertise in the development and operational transition of unmanned maritime systems. It may also coordinate with other federal agencies, the academic sector, and the private sector to maximize research opportunities and to support commercialization of unmanned maritime systems.

NOAA must make publicly available all data it collects using unmanned maritime systems.</summary>
