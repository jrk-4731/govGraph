This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission&#160;to conduct an annual inquiry on the availability of advanced telecommunications capability in broadband deserts, including whether such capability is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion and, if not, take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition. The term "broadband desert" means a census block in an urban area in which fewer than 33% of end-user premises do not have access to advanced telecommunications capability.</summary>
