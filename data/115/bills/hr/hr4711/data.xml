This bill prohibits a federal banking regulator from: (1) terminating or limiting the deposit insurance or share insurance of a depository institution solely because the institution&#160;provides financial services to a legitimate&#160;industrial hemp business; (2) prohibiting or otherwise discouraging a depository institution from offering financial&#160;services to such a business;&#160;(3) recommending, incentivizing, or encouraging a depository institution not to offer financial services to an account holder solely because the account holder is affiliated with such a business; or (4) taking any adverse or corrective supervisory action on a loan made to a person solely because the person either owns such a business or owns real estate or equipment leased to such a business.

As specified by the bill, a&#160;depository institution shall not,&#160;under federal law,&#160;be liable or subject to forfeiture&#160;for providing financial services to a legitimate industrial hemp business.</summary>
