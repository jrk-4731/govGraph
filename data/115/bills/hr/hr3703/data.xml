  <summary date="2017-09-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No School Bus Drivers with DUIs Act

The bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to prohibit any state, state educational agency, or local educational agency receiving ESEA funds from employing an individual as a school bus driver who has been convicted of, or pled guilty to, drunk driving or a driving violation that is a felony under state law.

Nothing in the bill shall be construed to prevent those entities from adopting a law, regulation, or policy that provides greater or additional protections prohibiting the employment of a school employee, contractor, or agent.

The Department of Education shall not have the authority to mandate, direct, or control the specific measures adopted by such entities.</summary>
