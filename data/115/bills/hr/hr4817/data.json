An Internet exchange facility is the physical infrastructure through which Internet service providers and content delivery networks exchange Internet traffic between their networks.\n\nThe bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to allow schools, libraries,\u00a0and rural health care providers that receive funds to pay for telecommunications to use the funds to contract with\u00a0a broadband provider to obtain a connection at an Internet exchange facility or to pay the costs for maintaining a connection at such a facility."
