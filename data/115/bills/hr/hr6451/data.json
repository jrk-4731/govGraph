In applying such criteria to refugees under UNRWA it shall be U.S. policy, consistent with the definition of a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that:\n\n derivative refugee status may only be extended to the spouse or minor child of such a refugee, and an alien who was firmly resettled in any country is not eligible to retain refugee status."
