Passive identification capability means technology that: (1) enables identification by a mobile or fixed reading device, and (2) does not transmit an electronic monitoring or tracking signal.\n\nIn developing a national standard, DOJ must prioritize certain considerations, including a firearm owner's right to privacy and right to legally own firearms and the ability of law enforcement authorities to use passive identification capability to track lost and stolen guns."
