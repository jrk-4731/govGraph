This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to revise the definition of&#160;"points and fees," for purposes of determining whether a mortgage is a "high-cost mortgage," to: (1)&#160;exclude compensation taken into account in setting the interest rate and for which the consumer was not separately charged, and (2) include compensation paid by a consumer or creditor to an individual employed by or contracting with a mortgage originator. (A high-cost mortgage designation restricts the terms of&#160;a loan and requires a lender to make certain disclosures to the borrower.)</summary>
