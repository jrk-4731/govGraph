  <summary date="2018-04-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">No Enforcement, No Grant for Sanctuary Cities Act of 2018

This bill prohibits a sanctuary jurisdiction from receiving federal funds under the state criminal alien assistance program for the fiscal year in which it was determined to be a sanctuary jurisdiction by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

"Sanctuary jurisdiction" means a state or political subdivision that has a statute, ordinance, policy, or practice that prohibits or restricts a government entity or official from:

 sending, receiving, maintaining, or exchanging with a federal, state, or local government entity information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status; or cooperating with a lawful DHS request to comply with a detainer for or notification about an individual's release. A state or political subdivision shall not be deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction based solely on having a policy whereby its officials will not share information or cooperate with a DHS request to comply with a detainer for an individual who is a crime victim or witness.</summary>
