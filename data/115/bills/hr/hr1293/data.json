The report must include at a minimum:\n\n the total amount of official time granted to employees, the average amount of official time expended per bargaining unit employee, the specific types of activities or purposes for which official time was granted and the impact on agency operations, the total number of employees to whom official time was granted and the number engaged exclusively in activities involving the use of official time, the total amount of compensation (including fringe benefits) afforded to employees granted official time, the total amount of official time spent by employees representing federal employees who are not union members, and a description of any room or space designated at the agency where official time will be conducted. The bill defines \"official time\" as any period of time granted to a federal employee to perform representational or consultative functions and during which the employee would otherwise be in a duty status."
