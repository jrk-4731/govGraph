 This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education to award grants to up to 10 institutions of higher education for pilot programs that reduce the cost of attendance for undergraduate students by expanding student access to digital course materials.

A preference is given to applications that demonstrate a commitment to serving disadvantaged students.

Grant recipients must make digital course materials available to undergraduate students in at least two different academic departments.</summary>
