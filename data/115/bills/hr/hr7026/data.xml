The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor shall award grants to certain community-based organizations to: (1) improve the financial literacy of women who are working age or in retirement, and (2) assist low-income women and victims of domestic violence in obtaining qualified domestic relations orders and the benefits they are entitled to through the orders.</summary>
