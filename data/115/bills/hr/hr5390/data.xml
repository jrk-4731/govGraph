This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise the free application for federal student aid (FAFSA) process for certain students. Specifically, the Department of Education must allow students to complete FAFSA as independent students under special circumstances.

Financial aid administrators must provide those students with an initial determination regarding their assistance in the same manner as, and by no later than the date that, they provide other independent students with that determination.</summary>
