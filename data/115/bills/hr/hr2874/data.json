    "text": "21st Century Flood Reform Act\n\nTITLE I--POLICYHOLDER PROTECTIONS AND INFORMATION\n\n(Sec. 101) This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to extend the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through FY2022.\n\n(Sec. 102) The bill changes annual minimums and limits on premium increases for specified policies subsidized through NFIP to: (1) increase the minimum from 5% to 5.5% for the second year after enactment, (2) increase the minimum from 5% to 6% for the third year, (3) increase the minimum from 5% to 6.5% for the fourth year and beyond, and (4) decrease the limit on annual premium increases from 18% to 15%.\n\n(Sec. 103) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must provide financial assistance through state programs for low income families to purchase NFIP insurance.\n\n(Sec. 104) FEMA must publish an annual explanation of flood insurance premiums and hold public meetings.\n\n(Sec. 105) FEMA must incorporate in premium rates the differences in coastal and riverine (inland) flood risk.\n\n(Sec. 106) FEMA's implementation of monthly premium payment schedules is exempted from rulemaking. FEMA may implement this schedule as a pilot program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the costs associated with monthly payment of premiums. FEMA must annually report on these costs.\n\n(Sec. 107) FEMA must clearly communicate to policyholders their property's full flood risk, the history of flood claims on their property, and the effect of filing further claims.\n\n(Sec. 108) FEMA must make data on historical claims, required coverage, and previous damage available to the current owner of the property within 30 days of a request.\n\n(Sec. 109) State or local governments must require a seller or lessor to disclose to a purchaser or lessee any previous flood damage or flood insurance claims, and any obligation to purchase flood insurance. This requirement, whether by statute or regulation, must be adopted for the area to qualify for participation in NFIP.\n\n(Sec. 110) FEMA may create a community-wide flood insurance pilot program that covers all residential and non-residential properties and satisfies the mandatory purchase requirement. (Federal agencies that oversee mortgage lending must mandate the purchase of flood insurance for properties located in special flood hazard areas.)\n\n(Sec. 111) FEMA must incorporate the replacement cost value of a structure insured under NFIP in its consideration of chargeable premium rates.\n\nFEMA must conduct a study regarding risk rating redesign utilizing replacement cost and report the findings to Congress.\n\n(Sec. 112) The flood insurance premium for a residential property having four or fewer residences is limited to no more than $10,000 a year, subject to adjustments for future inflation.\n\n(Sec. 113) In determining premium rates, FEMA shall offer a rate reduction if policyholders implement specified flood damage mitigation methods. Mitigation techniques that qualify for a rate reduction include methods that can be utilized on a block or neighborhood scale, and the elevation of mechanical systems.\n\n(Sec. 114) FEMA shall conduct a study of the feasibility of providing coverage for individual units in cooperative housing projects.\n\n(Sec. 115) FEMA is directed to establish a pilot program for \"Write Your Own\" companies (companies that write and service federal standard flood insurance policies in their own name) to investigate preexisting structural conditions in properties that may result in a denial of a claim in the event of a flood loss under NFIP.\n\n(Sec. 116) The bill establishes a Federal Flood Insurance Advisory Committee.\n\n(Sec. 117) The bill directs federal lending regulation entities and FEMA to update interagency guidance regarding flood insurance.\n\n(Sec. 118) The bill directs the GAO to report on claims adjustment practices under NFIP.\n\n(Sec. 119) The bill directs the GAO to report on NFIP coverage of earth movement and subsidence caused by flooding.\n\nTITLE II--INCREASING CONSUMER CHOICE THROUGH PRIVATE MARKET DEVELOPMENT\n\n(Sec. 201) The bill revises the financial requirements that apply to flood insurance for home loans or loan guarantees by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Private flood insurance must meet any financial strength requirements set forth by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nPrivate flood insurance may include policies issued by nonadmitted insurers (including surplus lines insurance) as long as the insurer is eligible to provide insurance in the home state of the insured and complies with the laws and regulations of that state. (Currently, private flood insurance must provide coverage at least as broad as coverage provided by NFIP.)\n\nFEMA must consider any period during which a property was continuously covered by private flood insurance to be a period of continuous insurance coverage, including for the purposes of NFIP subsidies.\n\nMutual aid societies may sell private flood insurance, subject to state law. The bill defines a mutual aid society as an organization of members who share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs. This coverage satisfies the mandatory purchase requirement.\n\n(Sec. 202) The required purchase of flood insurance is limited to residential properties (currently, the requirement applies to all types of property).\n\n(Sec. 203) FEMA must allow a Write Your Own company to sell private flood insurance.\n\n(Sec. 204) FEMA must provide data related to NFIP risks and premiums, including community-level data, through a publicly available data system.\n\n(Sec. 205) If an NFIP policyholder switches to private flood insurance during the NFIP coverage period, FEMA must refund any unused NFIP premium. Properties that have received a claim payment for that period or Increased Cost of Compliance mitigation assistance are not eligible for a refund.\n\n(Sec. 206) The GAO must report on the feasibility of reducing flood insurance premiums and eliminating the need for flood insurance coverage by authorizing flood damage savings accounts.\n\n(Sec. 207) If determined feasible by the GAO, FEMA must establish a demonstration program for flood damage savings accounts.\n\nTITLE III--MAPPING FAIRNESS\n\n(Sec. 301) In establishing premium rates, FEMA must use, in part, applicable flood insurance rate maps and other appropriate risk assessment models, data, and tools.\n\n(Sec. 302) FEMA denials of requests for updates to flood maps may be appealed.
