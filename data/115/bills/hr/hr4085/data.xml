  <summary date="2017-10-19T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Tax Policy Transparency Act 

This bill requires the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to make publicly available an analysis of the effects of major tax legislation, including: (1) a distributional analysis, (2) a dynamic distributional after-tax wage income analysis, and (3) a written summary of the results of the analyses.

During the 10-year period after major tax legislation is enacted into law, the JCT must submit to Congress annual updates for the estimates included in the analyses.

"Major tax legislation" includes legislation for which the estimate provided by the JCT and the Congressional Budget Office under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 incorporates the budgetary effects of changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, and other macroeconomic variables (commonly known as dynamic scoring).</summary>
