This bill directs the Drug Enforcement Administration to update schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act to include certain synthetic substances. A schedule I controlled substance is a drug, substance, or chemical that: has a high potential for abuse; has no currently accepted medical value; and is subject to regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act.

The bill exempts from treatment as a controlled substance any such synthetic substance that is manufactured, distributed, and used exclusively for research.</summary>
