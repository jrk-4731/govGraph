    "text": "Urban Agriculture Production Act of 2017\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish an urban agriculture outreach program to award grants for: (1) infrastructure; (2) land acquisition, land conversion, and soil and growing mechanism assistance; (3) education and training; (4) technical and financial assistance to farmers, producers, or ranchers in urban areas; and (5) other activities that support urban agriculture. USDA must give preference to grants for activities in historically underserved communities.\n\nUSDA must establish the position of Urban Agricultural Liaison.\n\nUSDA must award grants for scientific and community-based participatory research related to urban agriculture. The bill provides specified funds for the grants and requires USDA to give priority to outreach activities to be carried out in historically underserved communities.\n\nThe bill amends the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 to: (1) establish a program to provide loans and loan guarantees for projects or activities to establish, expand, and promote direct producer-to-consumer marketing and assist in the development of local food business enterprises; and (2) extend and provide additional funding for the Farmers' Market Promotion Program.\n\nThe bill amends the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 to extend the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and provide additional funding.\n\nThe bill amends the Census of Agriculture Act of 1997 to require additional USDA reporting on farmers' markets and agricultural production in urban areas."
