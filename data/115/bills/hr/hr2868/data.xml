National Flood Insurance Program Policyholder Protection Act of 2017

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to limit the chargeable flood insurance premium for a residential property having 4 or fewer residences to no more than $10,000 a year, subject to adjustments for future inflation.

(Sec. 3) In determining chargeable premium rates, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall offer a rate reduction if policyholders implement specified mitigation methods. Mitigation techniques that qualify for such rate reduction include methods that can be utilized on a block or neighborhood scale, and the elevation of mechanical systems.

(Sec. 4) FEMA shall conduct a study of the feasibility of providing coverage for individual units in cooperative housing projects.</summary>
