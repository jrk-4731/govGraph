Beginning in two years after the enactment of this bill, the CPI-E, instead of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, shall be used to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment for OASDI benefits.\n\nThe bill also includes surplus earnings in the\u00a0calculation of the primary insurance amount (i.e., the amount received by a beneficiary who elects to receive\u00a0OASDI benefits at\u00a0full retirement age).\n\nThe bill phases out and, after 2023, eliminates\u00a0the cap on compensation ($128,400 in 2018) subject to Social Security taxation."
