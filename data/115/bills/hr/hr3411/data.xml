  <summary date="2017-07-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration an Automated Driving System Cybersecurity Advisory Council. The council shall undertake information gathering activities, develop technical advice, and present best practices or recommendations to DOT regarding cybersecurity for the testing, deployment, and updating of automated driving systems for motor vehicles with respect to supply chain risk management, interactions with Information Sharing and Analysis Centers and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations, and a framework for identifying and implementing recalls of motor vehicles or equipment.

A "highly automated vehicle" is defined as a motor vehicle (excluding a commercial motor vehicle) equipped with an automated driving system.

An "automated driving system" is defined as the hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether such system is limited to a specific operational design domain.</summary>
