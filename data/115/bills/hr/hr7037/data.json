Revolving funds may be used to provide: (1) financial assistance to participants in the National Flood Insurance Program, including homeowners, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and local governments; or (2) support for leveraged loans or state bonds. Financial assistance may be used for elevation projects, flood-proofing activities, relocation or removal of buildings, environmental restoration, acquiring property, obtaining protective easements, and other activities identified by FEMA.\n\nStates must annually submit to FEMA a plan that identifies the intended uses of the state loan fund.\n\nStates may provide additional subsidies to low-income homeowners and recipients of financial assistance in low-income areas."
