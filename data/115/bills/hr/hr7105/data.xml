This bill subjects independent contractors of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) who provide medical care to veterans at VA facilities to the same federal tort laws for medical malpractice that apply to VA health care personnel. An insurance claim for malpractice benefits by a contractor-defendant shall be subrogated to the United States.

The VA shall: (1) revoke the authorization to provide VA care of a contractor who has been the defendant in at least three cases during a five-year period that resulted in a judgment or settlement against the United States, and (2) bring an adverse action against certain VA health care personnel for similar reasons.</summary>
