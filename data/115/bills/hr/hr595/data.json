    "text": "Bailout Prevention Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Federal Reserve Act to declare a borrower ineligible to borrow from any emergency lending program or facility unless the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) and all federal banking regulators with jurisdiction over the borrower certify that, at the time the borrower initially borrows under the program or facility, the borrower is not insolvent. Solvency shall be assessed by examining the last four months of relevant financial data and determining whether the fair value of the borrower's assets exceeds its liabilities, with appropriate adjustment for temporary illiquidity in the relevant markets.\n\nA borrower shall be deemed insolvent for such purposes if it is in bankruptcy, resolution under title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or any other federal or state insolvency proceedings, or is a bridge financial company or a bridge depository institution.\n\nA program shall be considered one with \"broad-based eligibility\" only if at least five companies are eligible to participate in the program in a significant manner.\n\nThe annual interest rate for emergency lending must be at least 500 basis points greater than the cost of borrowing for the Treasury for a commensurate loan term.\n\nThe Board may create an emergency lending program or facility that does not meet the broad-based eligibility requirement or the interest rate requirement, but only if Congress enacts into law a joint resolution of approval within 30 days.\n\nThe bill reduces the timing of various reporting requirements of the Government Accountability Office and the Board from 1-2 years to 60 days."
