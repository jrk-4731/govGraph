Current law bars claims for international terrorism that occur during an armed conflict between military forces. This bill specifies that designated foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists are not military forces.\n\nSecond, the bill makes available any asset of a terrorist party seized or frozen under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for the satisfaction of court-awarded judgments against the terrorist party.\n\nThird, it allows federal courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign non-state defendant that accepts benefits from the United States (e.g., foreign assistance)."
