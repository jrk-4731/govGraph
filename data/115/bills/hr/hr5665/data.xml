 This bill amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to expand the definition of "labor organization" to include any efforts of the labor organization to discuss or communicate with an employer the establishment of, or changes to, particular terms and conditions of employment and to include as an employee any individual whether or not the labor organization deals with the employer of such individual.

The bill also specifies that the list of labor organizations deemed by the Act as engaged in an industry affecting commerce shall not be considered an exhaustive list.</summary>
