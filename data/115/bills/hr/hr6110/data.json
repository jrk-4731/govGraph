The CMS must ensure that there are no payment incentives for using opioids instead of non-opioid alternatives and must make revisions accordingly.\n\nThe bill also requires payment under Medicare to federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics that have health care practitioners who are newly certified to provide medication-assisted treatment (e.g., buprenorphine).\n\n The bill also authorizes the suspension of payments to a pharmacy under the Medicare prescription drug benefit and MA prescription drug plans pending the investigation of a credible allegation of fraud by the pharmacy."
