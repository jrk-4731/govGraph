  <summary date="2017-06-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Stop Child Abuse in Residential Programs for Teens Act of 2017 

This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to require programs designed to modify behaviors of children in a residential environment (covered programs) to prohibit child abuse and neglect and meet other specified minimum standards.

HHS shall: (1) implement a review process for overseeing, investigating, and evaluating reports of child abuse and neglect at covered programs; and (2) establish a process to assist states in the oversight and enforcement of this bill.

HHS must refer any violation of minimum standards to the Department of Justice for appropriate action.

The bill amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to establish additional eligibility requirements for grants to states to prevent child abuse and neglect at residential programs.</summary>
