This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to establish the U.S. Employee Ownership Bank, which shall be authorized to provide, in accordance with specified terms, conditions, and other requirements,&#160;financial assistance to increase employee ownership of a company.

In addition, the bill amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act to specify that, in general, if an employer orders the closing of&#160;a plant or facility, the employer must offer its employees an opportunity to purchase the plant or facility though an employee stock-ownership plan or an eligible worker-owned cooperative.</summary>
