The bill requires this agreement to be modified such that: (1) the amounts previously borrowed by the GSEs from Treasury shall be treated as a loan,\u00a0in accordance with specified terms;\u00a0and (2) payments\u00a0made\u00a0under the agreement by\u00a0the GSEs to Treasury, including\u00a0payments made prior to the agreement's modification,\u00a0shall\u00a0be treated as payments of principal and interest under\u00a0such loan."
