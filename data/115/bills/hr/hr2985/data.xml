This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&#160;to modify health&#160;insurance plan options for Members of Congress elected from a state that receives a federal waiver of essential health benefits under the American Health Care Act of 2017, if that bill is enacted. Such Members shall not be eligible for government health plans and shall be eligible only for health insurance coverage with the lowest actuarial value (which is the&#160;plan that has&#160;the enrollee pay the highest percentage of cost sharing) in the individual market of that state.</summary>
