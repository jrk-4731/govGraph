The bill increases the limit to 35,000 inhabitants for determinations made under the program on or after April 1 of any fiscal year. In making a grant or loan on or after April 1, USDA must give priority to applications with respect to community facilities at which public safety, health care, and job training are to be provided.\n\nIn awarding grants for essential community facilities technical assistance and training, USDA must allow applications for grants from qualified organizations for the sole purpose of providing on-site training and technical assistance on a national or multi-state regional basis."
