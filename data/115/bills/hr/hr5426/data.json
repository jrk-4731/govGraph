The bill also requires USDA to establish and maintain a publicly available database that provides: (1) a compilation and analysis of effective conservation practices for soil health, nutrient management, and source water protection in varying soil compositions, cropping systems, slopes, and landscapes; and (2) a list of recommended new and effective conservation practices."
