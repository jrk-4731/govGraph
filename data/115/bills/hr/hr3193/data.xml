This bill amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to revise the death benefit for officers or employees of the CIA who die as a result of injuries sustained outside of the United States and whose death resulted from hostile or terrorist activities or occurred in connection with an intelligence activity having a substantial element of risk. Specifically, this bill authorizes the death benefit to be paid to the next of kin if the employee or officer does not have a surviving dependent. This provision applies retroactively.

Additionally, this bill sets a minimum death benefit of $100,000.</summary>
