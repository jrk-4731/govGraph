A covered educational institution is an institution that has enrolled 20 or more individuals using veterans educational assistance.\n\nThe bill increases VA funding for state approving agencies and requires the VA to provide such agencies with a cost of living adjustment that equals the same percentage increase as benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act."
