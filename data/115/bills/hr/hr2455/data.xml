  <summary date="2017-05-16T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Separation of Government and President's Financial Interests Act

This bill amends the federal criminal code to broaden the scope of an existing conflict-of-interest restriction on federal executive branch officials.

Current law prohibits a federal executive branch official from personally and substantially participating in a government matter in which that official (or an immediate family member, business partner, or associated organization of that individual) has a financial interest. This bill broadens the scope of the provision to also prohibit an executive branch official from personally and substantially participating in a government matter in which the President has a financial interest.</summary>
