  <summary date="2018-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Make Sanctuary Cities Pay for the Wall Act of 2018 

This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a DHS account for the planning, design, and construction of a U.S.-Mexico border barrier.

Certain housing, community development, and public works appropriations for sanctuary cities, localities, or states shall be withheld and deposited into such account.

DHS: (1) may decline to transfer an alien in its custody to a sanctuary jurisdiction regardless of whether such jurisdiction has issued a writ or warrant, (2) shall not transfer an alien under a final order of removal (or a restatement of an order of removal) to a sanctuary jurisdiction, and (3) shall determine and report to Congress each year which political subdivisions or states are sanctuary jurisdictions.</summary>
