The bill applies to requirements regarding:\n\n target 1 sodium, calorie limitations, and the percentage of grains made with enriched or whole grain flour. With respect to grains and meats served in school breakfasts, USDA must apply meal requirements in regulations that were in effect on September 12, 2008.\n\nThis bill also amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to repeal requirements for school food authorities to use a specified formula (known as paid lunch equity requirements) to establish a price for paid lunches served to students who are not certified to receive free or reduced price meals."
