  <summary date="2017-07-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill provides educational assistance to veterans who pursue certain apprenticeship programs registered with the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor.

It is the sense of Congress that apprenticeship programs that are not sponsored by program participants' employers should provide the participants with professional development resources and interview training.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shall carry out a pilot program to provide eligible veterans with the opportunity to enroll in certification programs in computer numerically controlled machining.

The Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress regarding the career technical training track of the VA's Transition Assistance Program, including its effectiveness in educating participants about apprenticeship opportunities.</summary>
