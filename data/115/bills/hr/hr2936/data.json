In such an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, the Department concerned shall study, develop, and describe only these two alternatives:\n\n the forest management activity, and the alternative of no action. In the case of the alternative of no action, the Department concerned shall evaluate:\n\n the effect of no action on forest health, habitat diversity, wildfire potential, insect and disease potential, and timber production; and the implications of a resulting decline in forest health, loss of habitat diversity, wildfire, or insect or disease infestation on domestic water supply in the project area, wildlife habitat loss, and other economic and social factors. The bill establishes categorical exclusions regarding certain other forest management actions.\n\n A process is established for declaration of a major disaster for wildfire on federal lands managed by specified federal land management agencies."
