  <summary date="2018-01-30T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Lessening Regulatory Burdens on our Farmers Act of 2018 

This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to allow producers who enroll in the Agricultural Risk Coverage or Price Loss Coverage programs during the first enrollment period after the next farm bill for a fiscal year after FY2018 to file a one-time program contract to enroll in the program for the duration of the farm bill, instead of enrolling annually.

If there is a change in a farming operation for which a producer on a farm has filed a one-time program contract permitted under this bill, the producer must filed an updated contract with USDA within one year of the time that the change occurs.</summary>
