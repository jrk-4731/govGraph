    "text": "Removing Extra Transportation Infrastructure Luxury Expenses Act or the RETILE Act\n\nThis bill prohibits a state or local government, for purposes of a project that receives public assistance disaster-related grants, from installing differently-colored tiles in a tunnel if such installation is reasonably expected to incur a higher cost than the installation of same-color tiles, and a waiver has not been obtained from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS may grant a waiver based on safety, historic preservation, or other factors.\n\nDHS must withhold funding for a federal-aid highway project if such project uses differently colored tiles in a tunnel and the installation of such tiles is reasonably expected to incur a higher cost than the installation of same-color tiles and DHS has not issued a waiver."
