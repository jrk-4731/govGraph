Services may be covered for a total of up to 30 days in a 12-month period for an eligible enrollee. States must include specified information in their applications, including plans to improve access to outpatient care.\n\nCurrent law generally prohibits federal payment under Medicaid for services provided in IMDs for individuals under the age of 65 (although states may receive payment through certain mechanisms, such as through a Medicaid demonstration waiver).\n\n(Sec. 3) Additionally, the bill temporarily eliminates the enhanced federal matching rate for Medicaid expenditures regarding specified medical services provided by certain managed care organizations."
