(The NAC is currently a five-state pilot program.)\n\nThe NAC is a database of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) information for states to use to prevent SNAP participants from receiving duplicative benefits in multiple states.\n\nThe bill requires all states to use the NAC when making SNAP eligibility determinations and specifies requirements for USDA regulations implementing this bill."
