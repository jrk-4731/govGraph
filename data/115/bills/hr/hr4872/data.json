It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing CR expired because none of the 12 FY2018 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted.\n\nThe bill also provides funding flexibility or additional funding for specified accounts within the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
