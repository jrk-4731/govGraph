(Contrast agents are substances used to enhance the visibility of body structures in medical imaging.) The FDA center that reviews medical devices has primary jurisdiction over such reviews.\n\nAfter authorization of a medical imaging device that makes new use of a contrast agent, the sponsor of the approved contrast agent may submit a supplemental application for the new use of the contrast agent."
