This bill prohibits the taking of an albatross or petrel without a permit, authorization, or exemption. USFWS, in consultation with NMFS, may authorize the taking of an albatross or petrel under exceptional circumstances or incidental to otherwise lawful activities.\n\nThis bill gives the USFWS, the NMFS, and the Coast Guard authority to enforce this bill.\n\nThis bill authorizes cooperation with other countries to achieve and maintain a favorable conservation status of albatrosses and petrels."
