A \"covered air carrier\" is defined as an air carrier that provides scheduled or public charter air transportation in an aircraft designed for a passenger capacity of 30 or more.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall designate a FAA office to receive and analyze reports involving fumes in the air conditioning and pressurization systems of commercial aircraft."
