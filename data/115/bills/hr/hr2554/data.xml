This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require each state that receives assistance under the Act to carry out a program under which graduates of 2-year community colleges with at least 2.0 grade point averages are: (1) automatically enrolled into 4-year public institutions of higher education (IHE) in the state if they meet the admission requirements, and (2) given credits at the 4-year IHE for courses from the community college. The participating 4-year IHEs in the state must meet periodically with first-year students at the community colleges to assist in developing and maintaining 4-year academic plans for the students.</summary>
