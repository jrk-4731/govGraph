The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)\n\n(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u00a0to authorize\u00a0the emergency use of an otherwise unapproved\u00a0medical product if the Department of Defense (DOD)\u00a0determines that there is a military emergency involving an agent that may cause imminently life-threatening and specific risk to U.S. forces. If a military emergency is determined to exist, the bill allows DOD to request that the FDA\u00a0expedite certain procedures for approving medical\u00a0products that would be reasonably likely to diagnose, prevent, treat, or mitigate such risk.\u00a0The FDA\u00a0must take specified\u00a0actions to facilitate such a request by DOD.\n\nThe bill repeals provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 that allow DOD, rather than the FDA,\u00a0to authorize the emergency use of an unapproved product under similar circumstances.\n\nUnless DOD determines\u00a0such meetings to be unnecessary, the FDA shall meet with\u00a0DOD:\u00a0(1) semi-annually to conduct a full review of relevant medical products in the DOD portfolio; and (2) quarterly to discuss the development status of regenerative medicine advanced therapy, blood, and vaccine medical products and projects that DOD prioritizes."
