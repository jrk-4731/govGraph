  <summary date="2017-05-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria

This joint resolution: (1) authorizes the President, for the next five years, to use all necessary and appropriate force to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or any associated persons or forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States, its Armed Forces, or its other personnel; and (2) is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.

Subject to a joint resolution of disapproval of such action, the use of force may take place in a country (other than Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Libya, or Yemen) if the President submits a report to Congress on the use of force in such country that: (1) names the country; (2) describes the presence of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, or associated persons or forces; and (3) justifies the use of force.

The bill repeals: (1) the Authorization for Use of Military Force enacted on September 18, 2001, and (2) the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.

The President shall report to Congress setting forth a comprehensive U.S. strategy encompassing military, economic, humanitarian, and diplomatic capabilities to protect the United States and defeat al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and ISIS.</summary>
