  <summary date="2018-05-22T13:24:27Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">This joint resolution requires the Department of State to periodically certify to Congress that Saudi Arabia is undertaking:

 efforts to conduct diplomatic negotiations to end the civil war in Yemen; measures to increase access for Yemenis to food, fuel, and medicine; measures to reduce civilian casualties from its military operations in Yemen; and actions to reduce humanitarian assistance shipment delays. If the State Department is unable to so certify, no federal funds may be obligated or expended for U.S. air refueling of non-U.S. aircraft conducting missions in Yemen other than missions related to:

 al Qaeda, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; countering the transport or employment of ballistic missiles or components in Yemen; helping coalition aircraft return safely to base in emergency situations; or force protection of U.S. aircraft, ships, or personnel. The President shall brief Congress regarding:

 Saudi Arabia's and the United Arab Emirates' military and political objectives in Yemen, efforts to avoid harming civilians, external support for the Houthi forces, and the effect of military operations on U.S. efforts to defeat al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The State Department shall submit to Congress a strategy for accomplishing U.S. objectives in Yemen.</summary>
