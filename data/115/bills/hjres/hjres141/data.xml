This joint resolution states that the only source of funding to directly or indirectly support or oppose a campaign for election to public office shall be either contributions by individual citizens to the principal campaign committee controlled by the candidate or funds provided under a system of public election financing or voter education established by Congress, the state, or other jurisdiction as appropriate.

The only source of funding that may be used to directly or indirectly support or oppose a ballot measure to amend a state constitution or other initiatives or referenda shall be either contributions made by individuals who are eligible to vote on the measure or funds provided under a system of public election financing or voter education established by the state.

 Congress, the states, and local jurisdictions shall establish limits on the amount of contributions individuals may make with respect to a single campaign for election to federal, state, or local office, respectively, including limits on the amount of contributions an individual who is a candidate for such office may make with respect to the individual's own campaign, and the states and local jurisdictions shall establish limits on the amount of contributions individuals may make with respect to a ballot measure.</summary>
