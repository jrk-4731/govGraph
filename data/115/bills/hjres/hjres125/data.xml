  <summary date="2018-01-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This joint resolution amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to extend the expiration date of the FY2018 Continuing Resolution (CR) from January 19, 2018, to February 16, 2018. The joint resolution provides continuing appropriations for federal agencies through the earlier of February 16, 2018, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation. It prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing CR expires.

 The joint resolution amends title XXI (Children's Health insurance Program) (CHIP) of the Social Security Act to extend funding through FY2023 for CHIP. In addition, the&#160;joint resolution: (1) extends through FY2023 funding for the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund, the Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project, the Pediatric Quality Measures Program, and specified outreach and enrollment grants; and (2) reauthorizes through FY2023 the qualifying-states option and the express-lane eligibility option.

Current law provides states with an enhanced Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for child-health assistance through FY2019. The joint resolution maintains the enhanced FMAP in FY2020, but halves the percentage-point increase.

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services shall make additional funding available to states for specified activities related to mechanized claims systems.

The joint resolution amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to suspend specified health-related taxes and fees.

Specified&#160;budgetary effects of the joint resolution shall be exempt from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules and certain budget scorekeeping guidelines.</summary>
