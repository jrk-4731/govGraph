The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nDIVISION A--FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018\n\nFurther Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018\n\n(Sec. 101) This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to extend the expiration date of the FY2018 Continuing Resolution (CR) from December 8, 2017, to December 22, 2017. The division provides continuing appropriations for federal agencies through the earlier of December 22, 2017, or the enactment of the applicable appropriations legislation. It prevents a government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing CR expires because none of the 12 FY2018 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted.\n\nDIVISION B--CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) ALLOCATION REDISTRIBUTION SPECIAL RULE\n\n(Sec. 201) This division amends title XXI (Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) of the Social Security Act to establish a special rule,\u00a0with respect to\u00a0the first quarter of FY2018,\u00a0for the redistribution of unused CHIP allotments to state child health plans\u00a0experiencing emergency shortfalls. Specifically, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0(CMS) must\u00a0redistribute\u00a0unused allotments to each\u00a0such state in an amount equal to the state's emergency shortfall before the CMS may redistribute the allotments to any state that is experiencing a nonemergency shortfall."
