  <summary date="2017-12-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">DIVISION A--FURTHER ADDITIONAL CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018

Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 

This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to most federal agencies through January 19, 2018 (December 22, 2017, under current law). It prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing continuing resolution expires because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted.

It also exempts security spending from sequestration (automatic spending cuts) for FY2018 and delays the sequestration for nonsecurity spending.

DIVISION B--DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS

This division provides appropriations to the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2018, including emergency appropriations for missile defense programs.

DIVISION C--CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS ACT

Continuing Community Health And Medical Professional Programs to Improve Our Nation, Increase National Gains, and Help Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers, and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable Act of 2017 or the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act 

This division extends the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) through FY2022 and also extends several other public health programs.

The division also increases Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands through FY2019 and modifies the Medicaid payment reductions for disproportionate-share hospitals (which receive additional payment under Medicaid for treating a large share of low-income patients).

In addition, the bill:

 modifies the grace period for paying health insurance premiums under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, reduces appropriations for the Prevention and Public Health Fund, alters third-party liability rules under Medicaid and CHIP, modifies the treatment of lottery winnings and other lump-sum income under Medicaid income eligibility rules, and eliminates Medicare premium subsidies for beneficiaries with annual incomes exceeding $500,000. DIVISION D--OTHER MATTERS

This division provides funding for the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to receive health care from providers outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities.</summary>
