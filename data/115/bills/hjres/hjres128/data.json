(Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)\n\nDIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018\n\nThis division provides appropriations to the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2018.\n\nDIVISION D--MISCELLANEOUS\n\nThis division amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the Department of Agriculture Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) through FY2019. (EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for agricultural producers and land owners to implement certain conservation practices.)\n\nDIVISION E--BUDGETARY EFFECTS\n\nThis division exempts the budgetary effects of division D from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules and certain budget scorekeeping guidelines."
