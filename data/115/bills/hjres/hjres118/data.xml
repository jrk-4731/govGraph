  <summary date="2017-10-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria

This joint resolution: (1) authorizes the President, for the next five years, to use all necessary and appropriate force to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or any person, other than a sovereign nation, that is a part of or substantially supports any such group and that has engaged in hostilities against the United States, the U.S. Armed Forces, or civilian personnel supporting the U.S. Armed Forces; and (2) is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution.

The President must report to Congress every 90 days describing actions taken pursuant to such authorization.

The bill repeals: (1) the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, and (2) the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.</summary>
