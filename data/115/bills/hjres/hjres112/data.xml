  <summary date="2017-07-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Islamist Extremism

This joint resolution authorizes the President to use the Armed Forces against the Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Shabab, Boko Haram, Al-Nusrah Front, the Haqqani-Network, the Taliban, Houthi's, Khorasan Group, Hezbollah, and any substantial supporters, associated forces, or closely related successor entities.

The President may add an organization if: (1) the President determines that the organization supports Islamist extremism and submits to Congress the organization's name and supporting documents, and (2) Congress enacts a joint resolution providing for the use of the Armed Forces against the organization.

This joint resolution is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization pursuant to section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution. Nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers Resolution.

The following provisions of law are repealed:

 The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, and The Authorization for Use of Military Force.</summary>
