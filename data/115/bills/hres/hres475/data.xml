  <summary date="2017-07-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Declares that the House of Representatives:

 supports the designation of National Month for Renters to draw attention to the U.S. rental affordability crisis; urges a national effort involving all levels of government, the private sector, and the philanthropic community to expand the supply of affordable rental homes to meet demand; and recognizes the adverse economic and social impact that unaffordable rents have on families and communities and that expanding access to affordable rental homes will help stabilize families and communities, promote equality of opportunity, and support greater economic growth and prosperity.</summary>
