  <summary date="2018-03-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes: (1) the contributions of the Montagnards who fought loyally and bravely with U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War and who continue to suffer persecution in Vietnam as a result of this relationship, and (2) that eligible Montagnards should be provided access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for resettlement in the United States and in other countries.

Condemns actions taken by the government of Vietnam to suppress the basic human rights and civil liberties of its citizens.

 Calls on Vietnam to allow human rights groups access to all regions of the country and to end restrictions of basic human rights, including the right for Montagnards to practice their Christian faith freely, the right to land and property, freedom of movement, the right to retain ethnic identity and culture, and access to an adequate standard of living.

Urges the President and Congress to develop policies that: (1) support Montagnards and other marginalized ethnic minority and indigenous populations, and (2) reflect U.S. interests and commitment to upholding human rights and democracy abroad.</summary>
