Prohibits the OEA from: (1) accepting awards of litigation expenses or costs under CAA hearings or civil actions, and (2) providing assistance to an employee after the individual files a civil action.

(Sec. 3) Requires the Office of the House Employment Counsel to continue carrying out all of its current functions.

(Sec. 4) Directs the Chief Administrative Officer of the House to require: (1) House offices to certify on Payroll Authorization Forms of House employees that payroll actions are not connected to CAA awards and settlements, and (2) House Members to certify on such forms that Members' Representational Allowance is not being used for CAA awards or settlements.

(Sec. 5) Amends Rule XXIII (Code of Official Conduct) of the Rules of the House to prohibit: (1) a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House from committing sexual harassment or engaging in unwelcome sexual advances; and (2) sexual relationships between Members and employees (except between married individuals).
