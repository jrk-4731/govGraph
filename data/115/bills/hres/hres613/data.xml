  <summary date="2017-11-09T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Supports providing members of the Armed Forces the opportunity to receive vocational trade training and credentialing opportunities for no cost.

Recognizes that: (1) such training promotes members' success in their post military career and life and will likely lead to a reduction in unemployment costs borne by the Department of Defense, and (2) veterans and employers benefit directly from ensuring that newly transitioned veterans are trained for growing career fields.

Celebrates the contribution well-trained veterans provide to the American workforce and economy.</summary>
