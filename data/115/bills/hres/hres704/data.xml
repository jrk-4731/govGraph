  <summary date="2018-01-18T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Offers condolences to the family of Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman. Recognizes his dedication to the investigation of the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Applauds Argentine President Mauricio Macri for calling for an independent investigation into Mr. Nisman's death and encourages the public release of the results. Recognizes the work of the Argentine National Gendarmerie in reviewing evidence to produce credible findings.

Commends the government of Argentina for exemplifying the rule of law and the importance of an independent justice system.

Urges the President of the United States to: (1) offer technical assistance to the government of Argentina in investigating Mr. Nisman's death and the AMIA bombing, and (2) continue to monitor Iran's activities in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Expresses concern about: (1) Iran's terrorist networks in Argentina and the Western Hemisphere, and (2) attempts by former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her government to discredit Mr. Nisman and raise unfounded hypotheses on his AMIA findings and the circumstances of his death.</summary>
