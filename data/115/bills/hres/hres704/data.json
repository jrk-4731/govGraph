Recognizes the work of the Argentine National Gendarmerie in reviewing evidence to produce credible findings.\n\nCommends the government of Argentina for exemplifying the rule of law and the importance of an independent justice system.\n\nUrges the President of the United States to: (1) offer technical assistance to the government of Argentina in investigating Mr. Nisman's death and the AMIA bombing, and (2) continue to monitor Iran's activities in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nExpresses concern about: (1) Iran's terrorist networks in Argentina and the Western Hemisphere, and (2) attempts by former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her government to discredit Mr. Nisman and raise unfounded hypotheses on his AMIA findings and the circumstances of his death."
