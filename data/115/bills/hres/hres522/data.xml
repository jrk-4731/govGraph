  <summary date="2017-09-14T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Recognizes that the United States needs to draw on the full diversity and talents of all Americans in order for it to be effective, innovative, and globally competitive.

Calls on the Department of State to: (1) provide attention and oversight to the employment, retention, and promotion of traditionally underrepresented groups; and (2) promote a diverse representation among mid- and senior-level career professionals through programs such as the International Career Advancement Program (ICAP).

Commends Dr. E. Thomas Rowe for his lifelong commitment to diversity and his belief that the diversity of American society should be reflected in its leadership.

Recognizes the important impact ICAP has had on the lives of its fellows and in advancing U.S. interests and values.</summary>
