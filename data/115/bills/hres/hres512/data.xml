  <summary date="2017-09-08T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to: (1) redesignate Rule XXIX (General Provisions) as Rule XXX; and (2) insert after Rule XXVIII (Reserved) new Rule XXIX (Statutory Limit on Public Debt) to reinstate the "Gephardt rule," repealed by H.Res. 5 (adopting the Rules of the House for the 112th Congress).

The Gephardt rule: (1) provided for an automatic engrossment and transmittal to the Senate of a joint resolution changing the public debt limit, upon the adoption of a budget resolution; and (2) avoided a separate vote in the House on public debt-limit legislation.</summary>
