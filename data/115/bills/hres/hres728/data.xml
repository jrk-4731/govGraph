  <summary date="2018-02-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Reaffirms U.S. support for Israel.

Condemns actions of the United Nations Human Rights Council as wasteful and abusive.

Supports remarks from Ambassador Nikki Haley in 2017 stating that the United States "does not seek to leave the council, but to reestablish its legitimacy."

Calls on the council to: (1) reform and become competitive and transparent in membership selection, and (2) stop singling out Israel as a permanent item on its agenda.

Urges Congress to support specified legislation that expands anti-boycott laws to extend to international organizations such as the United Nations and European Union.</summary>
