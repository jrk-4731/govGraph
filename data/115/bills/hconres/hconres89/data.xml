  <summary date="2017-11-01T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Expresses the sense of Congress that it should be U.S. policy to:

 make the treatment of the Tibetan people an important factor in the conduct of U.S. relations with the People's Republic of China; consistent with the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, encourage the Chinese government to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama leading to a negotiated agreement on Tibet, publicly call for the release of those held prisoner for expressing their political or religious views in Tibetan areas, and establish an office in Lhasa, Tibet, to assist visiting U.S. citizens and monitor political, economic, and cultural developments in Tibet; appoint the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues at the highest levels of government; revoke appropriate privileges of any Chinese official found responsible for impeding access of U.S. citizens to Tibet and ensure that reciprocal visa processing measures are occurring; continue to designate China as a country of particular concern pursuant to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998; and engage with appropriate Chinese officials to stop the demolition of Tibetan Buddhist religious institutions, revise religious and travel regulations to conform with international human rights standards, and ensure that Tibetan nomads are allowed to continue their way of life on the Tibetan Plateau and are not forcibly relocated into "socialist villages."</summary>
