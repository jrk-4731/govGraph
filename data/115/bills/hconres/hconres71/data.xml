  <summary date="2017-10-26T14:16:23Z" status="House agreed to Senate amendment without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on October 19, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Highlights: 

This concurrent resolution establishes the FY2018 congressional budget resolution, which provides a framework for congressional consideration of legislation addressing revenues, spending, and other budget-related issues. The budget resolution is a nonbinding framework used by Congress and cannot be signed into law or vetoed by the President.

The resolution establishes budget enforcement procedures by setting forth rules for applying budget points of order to various legislative proposals.

It also includes reconciliation instructions directing various congressional committees to report legislation that meets specified requirements regarding the effect on the deficit. Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.

The resolution also includes reserve funds that provide the chairmen of the congressional budget committees with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to legislation that meets specified criteria.

TITLE IV--BUDGET PROCESS

Subtitle A--Budget Enforcement

(Sec. 4101) Updates the existing point of order against advanced appropriations to conform to the new budget window. (Under this section, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2018 that first becomes available after FY2018, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2019 that first becomes available after FY2019. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each year).

(Sec. 4102) Extends the point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPS) to appropriations legislation for FY2018-FY2020. Limits CHIMPS that reduce budget authority in the budget year but do not decrease outlays over the period of the total of the current year, budget year, and all fiscal years covered under the most recently adopted budget resolution. Limit CHIMPS to: $17 billion for FY2018, $15 billion for FY2019, and $15 billion for FY2020.

(Sec. 4103) Establishes a point of order against appropriations legislation that includes CHIMPS that would cause the absolute value of the total budget authority of all CHIMPs affecting the Crime Victims Fund for FY2018 to exceed $11.224 billion.

(Sec. 4104) Establishes a point of order against a provision designating FY2018 funds as for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).

(Sec. 4105) Establishes a point of order against amendments to reconciliation bills considered pursuant to section 2001 if the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee is unable to determine the effect that the amendment or motion would have on budget authority, outlays, direct spending, entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, or surpluses.

(Sec. 4106) Repeals the existing Senate Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) point of order that prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified six- and eleven-year time periods.

Replaces the point of order with a new PAYGO point of order that continues the six-year and eleven-year time periods and adds two additional time periods during which the legislation may not cause or increase an on-budget deficit: (1) the current year, and (2) the budget year.

(Sec. 4107) Directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.)

Requires the estimates, to the extent practicable, to include the distributional effects across income categories resulting from major legislation.

(Sec. 4108) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust committee allocations, budgetary aggregates, allocations, and levels included in this resolution if, during the 115th Congress, a measure becomes law that amends the discretionary spending limits established under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

(Sec. 4109) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust: (1) discretionary spending limits established under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985; and (2) committee allocations, budgetary aggregates, allocations, and levels included in this resolution for legislation during the 115th Congress that provides wildfire suppression funding.

(Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest.
