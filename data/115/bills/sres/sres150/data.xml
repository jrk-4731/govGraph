Welcomes the celebration of World Press Freedom Day 2017 on May 3, 2017.

Commends journalists and media workers around the world for their role in promoting government accountability, defending democratic activity, and strengthening civil society, despite threats to their safety. Pays tribute to journalists who have lost their lives or liberty carrying out their work.

Calls on governments abroad to implement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 163 (1963) by investigating and seeking to resolve cases of violence against journalists and by reporting on the investigations.

Expresses concern about the threats to freedom of the press and expression around the world and condemns actions that suppress it.

Calls on the President and the&#160;Department of State to:

 build upon U.S. leadership in freedom of the press; improve the means by which the U.S. government identifies, publicizes, and responds to threats against freedom of the press around the world; urge foreign governments to conduct transparent investigations and adjudications of the perpetrators of attacks against journalists; and highlight the issue of threats against freedom of the press in the annual Human Rights Reports and year round.</summary>
