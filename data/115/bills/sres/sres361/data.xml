  <summary date="2017-12-14T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Declares that: (1) the United States should not tolerate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK's) possession of nuclear weapons or continued development of nuclear weapon and ballistic missile capabilities; (2) the United States and the international community should develop and implement the strictest sanctions regime and exhaust every reasonable diplomatic option to achieve the dismantlement of the DPRK's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs; and (3) the U.S. government should plan for every military contingency necessary to defend the American people and ensure regional and global security.

Acknowledges that the Republic of Korea and Japan would likely face immediate retaliation by the DPRK in response to any potential U.S. military action and, therefore, any such action should be coordinated with those governments.

Asserts that Congress should be consulted prior to any use of military force, recognizes that Congress possesses the authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, and affirms that congressional authorization is needed prior to any pre-emptive or preventative ground war on the Korean Peninsula initiated by U.S. forces.</summary>
