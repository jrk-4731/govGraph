Senate Anti-Harassment Training Resolution of 2017

(Sec. 3) Requires Senators, Senate officers, and Senate managers to periodically complete training that addresses workplace harassment, including sexual harassment and related intimidation and reprisal prohibited under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 and their role in recognizing and responding to harassment and harassment complaints.

Requires Senate employees, interns, fellows, and detailees to periodically complete similar training. Requires the head of an office, including a joint commission or joint committee, employing Senate employees to ensure that an individual serving in a covered position or as a Senate manager in the office has access to the training.

(Sec. 4) Requires individuals to complete such training within 60 days after: (1) adoption of this resolution; or (2) assuming a Senate position, if after such adoption. Deems individuals to have completed training if they completed training during the 115th Congress.

(Sec. 5) Directs each office, including a joint commission or joint committee, employing Senate employees to certify whether covered individuals have completed such training during that Congress. Requires the Secretary of the Senate to publish the certification on its public website.</summary>
