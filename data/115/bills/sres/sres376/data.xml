  <summary date="2018-01-23T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Condemns: (1) the violence and displacement inflicted on Burma's (Myanmar's) Rohingya and other ethnic minorities, and (2) the attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army militant group. Calls for an immediate halt to all hostilities by Burmese authorities.

Calls on:

 the government of Burma to allow full access to Rakhine State and to ensure the full participation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and that the voices of refugees are represented, the UNHCR and international nongovernmental organizations to play a role in monitoring repatriation efforts by the governments of Bangladesh and Burma, and the United Nations to consider the feasibility of Bangladesh's proposal for a safe zone or for a peacekeeping mission to protect vulnerable communities under international supervision. Commends: (1) the positive role of the government of Bangladesh in receiving Rohingya refugees and urges that government to continue allowing the full participation of the UNHCR and human rights organizations in accessing refugee camps, and (2) the Bangladesh's efforts to provide shelter and relief for such refugees.

Calls for any return of Rohingya to include specified guarantees.

Recognizes that any forced relocation of Rohingya refugees into areas not of their choosing is unacceptable.

Calls on the government of Burma to:

 allow for a flexible and practical approach to dealing with evidence of Rohingya residence in Burma; address root causes consistent with the Rakhine Advisory Commission recommendations and fully implement such recommendations; address the issue of statelessness for the Rohingya, the deprivation of rights, and institutionalized and pervasive discrimination; and release journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. Calls on the government of Bangladesh to ensure that all refugees have freedom of movement and are not subject to unsafe, involuntary, precipitous, or uninformed returns to Burma.</summary>
