Condemns political violence in Cambodia and urges the cessation of human rights violations.

Urges:

 Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's Party to end all harassment and intimidation of Cambodia's opposition and foster an environment where democracy can thrive and flourish; the Department of the Treasury to consider placing all senior Cambodian government officials implicated in such abuses on the Specially Designated Nationals list; and the Cambodian government to free Mr. Kem Sokha and to respect freedom of the press and the rights of its citizens to freely assemble, protest, and speak out against the government. Supports electoral reform efforts in Cambodia and free and fair elections in 2018.</summary>
