  <summary date="2018-01-30T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Reaffirms: (1) the proud U.S. history of refugee resettlement, and (2) the strong bipartisan commitment to promote the safety, health, and well-being of refugees.

Recognizes: (1) January 27, 2018, as the anniversary of the first refugee and Muslim ban; and (2) the profound consequences faced by refugees and their families who have been stranded, separated, and scarred by current U.S. policies.

Underscores the importance of the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program as a critical tool for U.S. global leadership.

Calls upon the U.S. government to: (1) resettle 45,000 refugees in FY2018 and at least 75,000 refugees in FY2019, (2) uphold its international leadership role in responding to displacement crises with humanitarian assistance and protection of the most vulnerable populations, and (3) recommit to offering freedom from oppression and to resettling the most vulnerable refugees regardless of their country of origin or religious beliefs.</summary>
