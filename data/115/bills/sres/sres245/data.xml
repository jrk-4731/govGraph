  <summary date="2017-10-31T13:29:30Z" status="Passed Senate without amendment">(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Calls on the government of Iran to: (1) release Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi, Xiyue Wang, Nizar Zakka, and any other U.S. citizen, legal permanent resident alien, or foreign national being unjustly detained in Iran; and (2) fulfill its promises to assist in locating and returning Robert Levinson.

Urges the President to: (1) take whatever steps are in the national interest to secure the release of such individuals, and (2) make the release of U.S. citizens and legal permanent resident aliens held hostage by the Iranian government the highest of priorities.

Requests the United States and its allies whose nationals and residents have been detained to consider establishing a multinational task force to work to secure the release of the detainees.</summary>
