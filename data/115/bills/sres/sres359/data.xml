  <summary date="2017-12-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Commends: (1) the government of Bangladesh for its compassion and tolerance in accepting Rohingya refugees; (2) the United Nations (U.N.) agencies, nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners, and aid workers providing relief to such refugees; and (3) Pope Francis for his remarks about the future of Burma (Myanmar) that respects the rule of law, the democratic order, and the dignity and rights of all of its people.

Urges the government of Bangladesh to continue to help coordinate critical humanitarian work and ensure ease of access for those carrying out such work.

Urges the governments of Bangladesh and Burma to: (1) consult and coordinate with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration, and NGO partners on safe and voluntary repatriation efforts; and (2) address the flaws of the November 23, 2017, Memorandum of Understanding on repatriation through consultation and agreement with the Commissioner.

Calls on all parties involved in the repatriation process to reject any actions that could continue or worsen the harsh conditions faced by Rohingya refugees.</summary>
