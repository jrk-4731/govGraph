    "text": "Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2018 \n\nThis bill imposes a fee on the carbon content of fuels, including crude oil, natural gas, coal, or any other product derived from those fuels that will be used so as to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nThe fee is imposed on the producers or importers of the fuels and is equal to the greenhouse gas content of the fuel multiplied by the carbon fee rate. The rate begins at $15 in 2019, increases by $10 each year, and is subject to further adjustments based on the progress in meeting specified emissions reduction targets. The bill also imposes a specified fee on fluorinated greenhouse gases.\n\nThe bill includes:\n\n exemptions for fuels used for agricultural or nonemitting purposes, rebates for facilities that capture and sequester carbon dioxide, and border adjustment provisions that require certain fees or refunds for carbon-intensive products that are exported or imported. The fees must be deposited into a Carbon Dividend Trust Fund and used for administrative expenses and dividend payments to U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The fees must be decommissioned when emissions levels and monthly dividend payments fall below specified levels.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must evaluate the effectiveness of the fees at reducing emissions. If the targets specified in this bill have been met or exceeded, the EPA may review certain regulations related to the fuels and fluorinated greenhouse gases on which the fees have been imposed."
