 This bill deems certain service performed before July 1, 1946, in the organized military forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts to be active military service for purposes of eligibility for veterans' benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

 The VA shall, in determining eligibility under this bill, take into account any relevant service documentation, including documentation other than the Missouri List (the list of all discharged and deceased veterans from the 20th century).

 The VA shall report to Congress annually regarding the number of individuals applying for benefits, and the number approved, during the previous year.</summary>
