(Sec. 2) This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish, within the Office of the Chief Information Officer, a bug bounty pilot program to minimize vulnerabilities to DHS Internet-facing information technology.

 A "bug bounty program" is a program under which an approved individual, organization, or company is temporarily authorized to identify and report vulnerabilities of Internet-facing information technology of DHS in exchange for compensation.

Under such program, DHS shall:

 provide compensation for reports of previously unidentified security vulnerabilities within the websites, applications, and other DHS Internet-facing information technology that are accessible to the public; award a competitive contract tomanage the pilot program and for executing the remediation of vulnerabilities identified bythe program; designate mission-critical operations within DHS that should be excluded from the pilot program; consult with the Department of Justice on how to protect from prosecution approved individuals or entities who comply with the requirements of the program; develop an expeditious process for registration, background checks, and eligibility determinations for participation in the pilot program; and engage interested persons about the structure of the program. DHS must report to Congress on the program within 180 days of its completion.</summary>
