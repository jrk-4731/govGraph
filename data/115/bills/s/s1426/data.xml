This bill amends the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act to include among the purposes of the U.S. Olympic Committee to promote a safe environment in sports that is free from abuse, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, of any amateur athlete.

The bill designates the United States Center for Safe Sport, which shall:

 serve as the independent national safe sport organization for the United States; exercise jurisdiction over the committee, each national governing body, and each paralympic sports organization with regard to safeguarding amateur athletes against abuse in sports; maintain an office for education and outreach that shall develop training, oversight practices, policies, and procedures to prevent the abuse of amateur athletes; ensure that such policies and procedures require that all such bodies and organizations follow the center's policies and procedures; maintain an office for response and resolution that shall establish mechanisms that allow for the reporting, investigation, and adjudication of alleged sexual abuse in violation of the center's policies and procedures; and ensure that such mechanisms provide fair notice and an opportunity to be heard and protect the privacy and safety of complainants. The center may utilize a neutral arbitration body and develop policies and procedures to resolve allegations of sexual abuse within its jurisdiction.

The center shall: (1) develop training, oversight practices, policies, and procedures for implementation by such body or organization to prevent abuse of any amateur athlete; (2) keep correct and complete records of account; and (3) report annually to Congress.

The center, and each national governing body and paralympic sports organization, shall not be liable for damages in any civil action for defamation, libel, slander, or damage to reputation arising from the execution of its responsibilities or functions.</summary>
