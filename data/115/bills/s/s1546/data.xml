  <summary date="2017-07-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Commonsense Competition and Access to Health Insurance Act

This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to permit states to enter into interstate health care choice compacts under which qualified health plans may be offered in the small group market in all participating states while being subject to the laws and regulations of only the state in which the plan was written or issued. (Currently, interstate health care choice compacts apply to only qualified health plans in the individual market.)

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must request that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) report on health plans provided for under interstate health care choice compacts. HHS may also request that the NAIC include in the report concepts gathered from entities that have experience in offering qualified health plans in states in which those plans were not originally issued.</summary>
