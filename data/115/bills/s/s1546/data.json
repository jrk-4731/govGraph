(Currently, interstate health care choice compacts apply to only qualified health plans in the individual market.)\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must request that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) report on health plans provided for under interstate health care choice compacts. HHS may also request that the NAIC include in the report concepts gathered from entities that have experience in offering qualified health plans in states in which those plans were not originally issued."
