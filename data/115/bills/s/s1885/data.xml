  <summary date="2017-11-28T14:01:30Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act or the AV START Act

This bill: (1) establishes a framework for a federal role in ensuring the safety of highly automated vehicles (HAVs); (2) preempts states from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any law, rule, or standard regulating an HAV or automated driving system (ADS) regarding certain safety evaluation report subject areas; (3) sets forth conditions under which HAVs may be introduced into interstate commerce for testing, evaluation, or demonstration; and (4) applies certain safety exemptions to HAVs.

The Department of Transportation shall: (1) establish a technical committee on HAV and ADS safety, (2) establish a working group on ADS education efforts, and (3) research the traffic safety implications of HAVs.

Each HAV or ADS manufacturer shall execute a written plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks.

HAV Data Access Advisory Committee Act

The Department of Commerce shall establish the HAV Data Access Advisory Committee to provide a forum to discuss and make policy recommendations with respect to the information or data that vehicles collect, generate, record, or store in an electronic form that is retrieved from an HAV or ADS.

Commerce shall:

 develop educational cybersecurity resources to assist consumers in minimizing potential motor vehicle cybersecurity risks; initiate a study on impacts of HAVs on transportation infrastructure, mobility, the environment, and fuel consumption; study ways to encourage U.S. manufacturing of automated driving equipment; and issue a final rule regarding a child safety system to alert motor vehicle operators to check rear designated seating positions after the engine is deactivated. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration shall create a publicly accessible database containing information collected about individuals during motor vehicle operation and privacy policies and protections.</summary>
