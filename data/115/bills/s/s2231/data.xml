This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to make an institution of higher education (IHE) ineligible for federal student financial aid programs for two fiscal years if a certain percentage of its students are not able to start repaying the principal of their loans by specified deadlines.

The Department of Education must award grants to IHEs that have a strong record of supporting low- and moderate-income students. The bill funds the grants by requiring IHEs with certain nonrepayment loan balances to make risk-sharing payments. Grants may be used to increase college access and success for the students using investments and practices such as: awarding additional need-based financial aid, enhancing academic and student support services, and accelerated learning opportunities.</summary>
