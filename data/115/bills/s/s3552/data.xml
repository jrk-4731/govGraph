This bill amends the Small Business Act to revise the loan amount above which a real estate appraisal is required for a commercial real property securing a small business loan. Specifically, the bill ties the amount to the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold. (Currently, an appraisal is required for a loan of more than $250,000.)</summary>
