A supervisor must receive written notice specifying the reasons for the proposed action and the right of the supervisor to review the material which is relied on to support the reasons for the proposed action. A supervisor is entitled to 14 days following the notice to answer and furnish evidence in support of the answer.\n\n(Sec. 105) Agencies must refer information about employee suicides to the OSC indicating whether, prior to the death of\u00a0the employee,\u00a0any disclosure of information was made evidencing: (1)\u00a0a violation of\u00a0any law, rule, or regulation; (2) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial danger to public health or safety; or (3) whether any personnel action was taken against the employee as a result.\n\n(Sec. 106) Agencies must\u00a0provide training on how to respond to complaints alleging a violation of whistle-blower protections\u00a0to: (1) any employee appointed to a supervisory position in the agency who has not previously served as a supervisor; and (2) on an annual basis, to all employees serving in a supervisory position.\n\n(Sec. 107) Agencies must: (1)\u00a0provide information regarding whistle-blower protections to new employees during probationary periods, (2) inform employees of the role of the OSC and the MSPB with regard to whistle-blower protection, and (3) make information about such protections available on agency websites.\n\nTITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS EMPLOYEES\n\n(Sec. 201) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must submit a plan to Congress on efforts to prevent\u00a0any unauthorized access to the medical records of VA employees.\n\n(Sec. 202) The VA must conduct an outreach program to inform its employees of any mental health services, including telemedicine options.\n\n(Sec. 203) The VA must ensure protocols are in effect to address threats against VA employees providing health care.\n\n(Sec. 204) The GAO shall conduct a study to assess the reporting, staffing, accountability, and chain of command structure of the VA police officers at VA medical centers."
