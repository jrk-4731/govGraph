The DEA may deny an application if it determines that the registration is inconsistent with the public interest.\n\nAn EMS agency may obtain a single registration in each state instead of a separate registration for each location.\n\nA registered EMS agency may deliver, store, and receive controlled substances, subject to specified conditions.\n\nAn EMS professional of a registered EMS agency may administer controlled substances in schedules II, III, IV, or V outside the physical presence of a medical director if such administration is authorized under state law and pursuant to a standing or verbal order, subject to specified conditions.\n\nThe bill specifies that a hospital-based EMS agency (i.e., an EMS agency owned or operated by a hospital) may continue to administer controlled substances under the hospital's DEA registration.\n\n(Sec. 3) A pharmacy may deliver a controlled substance to an administering practitioner in accordance with this bill's requirements, subject to specified conditions.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report to Congress on access to and the potential diversion of controlled substances administered by injection, implantation, or through the use of an intrathecal pump."
