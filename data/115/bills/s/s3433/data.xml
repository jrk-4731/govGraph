This bill exempts firefighters and law enforcement officers with at least five years of service from the government pension offset and windfall elimination requirements under the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. Under current law, those provisions reduce OASDI benefits for individuals who receive a pension based on earnings in government employment that was not covered under the Social Security program.</summary>
