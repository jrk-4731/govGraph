(Under current law, a \"qualified conservation contribution\" is the contribution of a qualified real property interest to a qualified organization exclusively for conservation purposes.)\n\nThe limitation applies for the first five years after the individual becomes a partner in the partnership. It does not apply to certain family partnerships."
