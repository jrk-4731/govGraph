The fees:\n\n apply to large regulated banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, and federally registered investment advisors who are QPAMs; must be at least $1 million per application for an individual exemption; and increase based on the severity of the crime and the number of prior applications for individual exemptions. Labor must transfer the amounts collected from the user fees to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to assist in guaranteeing benefits under pension plans."
