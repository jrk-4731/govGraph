The bill specifies those individuals and professionals who are required to report suspected or known incidents of child abuse or neglect. HHS shall collect information on state laws for mandatory reporting of incidents of child abuse or neglect in order to assess the implementation of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act."
