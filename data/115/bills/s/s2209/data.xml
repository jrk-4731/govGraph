  <summary date="2017-12-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Prioritizing the Most Vulnerable Over Lottery Winners Act of 2017

This bill specifies how a state must treat&#160;qualified lottery winnings and lump sum income for purposes of determining an individual's income-based eligibility for a state Medicaid program. Specifically, a state shall include such winnings or income as income received: (1) in the month in which it was received, if the amount is less than $80,000; (2) over a period of two months, if the amount is at least $80,000 but less than $90,000; (3) over a period of three months, if the amount is at least $90,000 but less than $100,000; and (4) over an additional one-month period for each increment of $10,000 received, not to exceed 120 months.

An individual whose income exceeds the applicable eligibility threshold due to qualified lump sum income shall continue to be eligible for medical assistance to the extent that the state determines that denial of eligibility would cause undue medical or financial hardship.

With respect to an individual who loses eligibility due to qualified lump sum income, a state must provide specified notice and assistance related to the individual's potential enrollment in a qualified health plan under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Qualified lump sum income includes: (1) monetary winnings from gambling; (2) damages&#160;received&#160;in lump sums or periodic payments,&#160;excluding monthly payments, on account of causes of action other than those arising from personal physical injuries or sickness; and (3) income received as liquid assets from the estate of a deceased individual.</summary>
