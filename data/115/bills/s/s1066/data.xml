This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to allow a person to request the removal of a previously reported default regarding a qualified education loan from a consumer report if: (1) the lender chooses to offer a loan-rehabilitation program that requires a number of consecutive on-time monthly payments equal to the number of payments specified in a default reduction program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, and (2) the consumer of the&#160;loan successfully and voluntarily meets the requirements of that loan-rehabilitation program. A&#160;consumer may&#160;obtain such rehabilitation benefits only once per loan.

The Government Accountability Office shall&#160;report on any hurdles borrowers experience with the private loan-rehabilitation program.</summary>
