This bill amends the Small Business Act to revise the duties of the Office of the National Ombudsman (ONO) to include working with federal agencies that have regulatory authority over small businesses or that provide support to small businesses to develop best practices for helping small businesses comply with agency rules through training, webinars, and compliance guides.

The ONO must collaborate with each federal agency to establish a procedure relating to how the agency will provide information to: (1) small businesses regarding the ONO; and (2) the ONO regarding the nature, scope, and resolution of requests to the agency from small businesses about proposed, final, or existing rules.

The ONO must:

 conduct a robust outreach initiative to increase its visibility and promote awareness of its available services; and appoint additional individuals to provide education, training, and compliance assistance to small businesses.</summary>
