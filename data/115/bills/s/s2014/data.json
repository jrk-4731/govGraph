If it is determined, after a specified procedure, that the proposed rule will, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the federal agency shall then perform both an initial and a final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule.\n\nAn initial regulatory flexibility analysis is prepared in order to ensure that the agency has considered all reasonable regulatory alternatives that would minimize the rule's economic burdens or increase its benefits for the affected small entities, while achieving the objectives of the rule or statute.\n\nThe request must explain why the SBA disagreed with the certification and statement providing the factual basis for it."
