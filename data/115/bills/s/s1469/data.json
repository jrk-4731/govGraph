Under current law, an election to expense the costs of a film, television, or live theatrical production must be made by the due date for filing a tax return for the year in which the costs are first incurred. With respect to live theatrical productions, the bill modifies the rule to require an election to be made by the due date for filing a tax return for the taxable year in which the production holds its first public performance for a paying audience."
