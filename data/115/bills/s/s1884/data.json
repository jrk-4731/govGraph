Such required reports may be combined into a quarterly report to Congress. This reporting requirement shall not apply in instances in which DHS, DOJ, the FBI, or the NCC determines that the information required to be reported could jeopardize an ongoing investigation or prosecution, in which case Congress shall be notified of such determination before the first anniversary of the completion of the investigation.\n\nEach such report shall include: (1) a statement of the facts of the act of terrorism, (2) an explanation of any gaps in national security that could be addressed to prevent future acts of terrorism, (3) recommendations for additional measures that could be taken to improve homeland security, and (4) a summary of the report for public distribution."
