    "text": "Uniting and Strengthening American Liberty Act of 2017 or the USA Liberty Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to allow the contents of communications by persons outside of the United States to be accessed if\u00a0the Department of Justice (DOJ)\u00a0determines there is probable cause to believe that those contents may provide evidence of a crime or that such persons are agents of a foreign power.\n\nNoncontent communication information\u00a0may be accessed only if DOJ determines that the noncontent information is relevant to an authorized\u00a0investigation or assessment.\n\nDOJ must establish specific procedures when unmasking information is requested. (Unmasking means providing the identity of a U.S. person mentioned in an intelligence report that contains a reference to the person but does not identify the person.)\n\nThe National Security Act of 1947 is amended to prevent federal employees from taking any personnel action against a contractor employee who has made a lawful disclosure of information that the contractor employee believes provides evidence of a violation of federal law or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\n\nThe bill\u00a0extends to September 30, 2023, the\u00a0authorization of title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which allows DOJ and the Office of the\u00a0Director\u00a0of\u00a0National Intelligence to jointly authorize the electronic surveillance of non-U.S.\u00a0persons who are outside the United States.\n\nThe bill increases the criminal penalty (from one to up to five years imprisonment) for knowingly removing classified information without authority and with intent to retain such information at an unauthorized location.\n\nThe bill directs the Government Accountability Office to study the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and the U.S. classification system."
