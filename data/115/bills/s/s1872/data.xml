This bill reauthorizes Transportation Security Administration (TSA) programs through FY2020 and modifies the authorities, requirements, and organizational structure for the TSA.

 The bill codifies the transfer of the TSA from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security. It also establishes a five-year term for the TSA Administrator.

The bill also requires the TSA to:

 authorize third-party testing and evaluation of screening technology; develop a validation process for the reciprocal recognition of security equipment technology approvals among international security partners or recognized certification authorities for deployment; make information on wait times at airport security checkpoints publicly available in real time online and at airport terminals; develop and issue certification standards for the use of third-party explosives detection canine teams for screening of individuals, property, and air cargo; establish private sector partnerships to increase the methods and capabilities available for the public to enroll in the PreCheck Program; and meet specified targets for expanding PreCheck enrollment.</summary>
