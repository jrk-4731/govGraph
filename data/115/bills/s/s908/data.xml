  <summary date="2017-04-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Make It in America Act

This bill directs the Office for Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to promulgate specified regulations to standardize and simplify how federal agencies comply with, report on, and enforce the Buy American Act, including rules to ensure that a project is not disaggregated for purposes of avoiding the applicability of such requirements.

The bill: (1) directs the OFPP to issue rules to evaluate domestic content in a "manufactured end product," (2) requires domestic component costs to exceed 75% before manufactured materials are considered manufactured "substantially all" from U.S. materials, (3) excludes contract start-up costs from a domestic offer in comparisons of offers between domestic and nondomestic entities, (4) prohibits agencies from determining that the acquisition costs of U.S. materials is unreasonable unless it would increase overall acquisition cost by more than 25%, and (5) applies Buy American requirements to materials for use outside the United States that are not needed on an urgent basis or that are acquired on a regular basis.

An agency may not determine that sufficient material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States unless: (1) domestic production cannot be initiated without significantly delaying the project; and (2) sufficient substitutable material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

The bill: (1) revises reporting requirements regarding total federal agency acquisitions of materials acquired from entities that mine, produce, or manufacture them outside the United States; and (2) requires the U.S. International Trade Commission to submit an industry analysis of the capabilities of the domestic information technology and semiconductor industry to supply the federal government with domestically manufactured information technology systems.</summary>
