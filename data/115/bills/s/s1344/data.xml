This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to revise the Family-Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program,&#160;an employment and savings incentive program for families that reside in public housing or have housing vouchers. Specifically, the bill:

 combines existing, separately&#160;operated FSS programs into a single program; extends program eligibility to tenants of certain privately owned properties&#160;subsidized with project-based rental assistance; revises program requirements related to eligibility,&#160;supportive services, and&#160;escrow deposits; and otherwise&#160;modifies the&#160;FSS program.</summary>
