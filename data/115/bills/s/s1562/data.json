Such prohibition shall not apply if U.S. Customs and Border Protection finds that the goods were not produced with trafficked, convict, forced, or indentured labor.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission shall require issuers of stock and other securities to disclose annually any investments in North Korea and activities potentially sanctionable under this bill."
