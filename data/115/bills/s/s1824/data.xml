This bill declares that the mission of the Appalachian Regional Commission shall be to focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent poverty. The headquarters of the commission shall be located in that region.

The bill increases from 50% to 60% the minimum amount of the grant expenditures approved by the commission that shall support activities or projects that benefit severely and persistently distressed counties and areas.

The commission shall: (1) allocate at least 60% of the funds made available each fiscal year for its Area Development Program for projects in counties designated as distressed, and (2) submit an annual report on the allocation of program funds to such counties.</summary>
