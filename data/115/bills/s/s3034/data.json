The jobs accelerators are centers or programs that may provide co-working space, in-demand skills training, entrepreneurship support, and other specified services.\n\nUSDA must establish an interagency federal task force to support the network of jobs accelerators by providing certain information, technical assistance, support services, and opportunities for collaboration.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes and modifies the USDA Rural Business Investment Program. The modifications address the limitation on rural business and investment companies controlled by Farm Credit System institutions and coordination with the Small Business Administration Small Business Investment Company program."
