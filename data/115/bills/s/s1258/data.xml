  <summary date="2017-05-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Police Reporting Information, Data, and Evidence Act of 2017 or the PRIDE Act

This bill requires a state or Indian tribe that receives funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to report on use-of-force incidents involving a law enforcement officer and a civilian.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) may reduce by up to 10% the JAG allocation of a state or Indian tribe that fails to comply.

The bill authorizes DOJ to make grants to law enforcement agencies to comply with reporting requirements, establish reporting systems, promote public awareness, and train law enforcement personnel with respect to use-of-force incidents.</summary>
