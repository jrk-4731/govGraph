Covered actions are risk, exposure, or hazard assessments, criteria documents, standards, limitations, regulations, regulatory impact analyses, or guidance. Personally identifiable information, trade secrets, or commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential must be redacted prior to public availability.\n\nThe EPA may use an existing website maintained by another federal agency to make the scientific and technical information available."
