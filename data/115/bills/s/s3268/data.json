    "text": "Stop Child Summer Hunger Act of 2018\n\nThis bill amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the Department of Agriculture to establish a program providing eligible households with summer Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards in order to give children access to food during the summer months to: (1) reduce or eliminate children's food insecurity and hunger, and (2) improve their nutritional status.\n\nAn \"eligible household\" is a household that includes one or more children who are eligible to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs.\n\nThe amount on each summer EBT card is set at $150 per child in 2019, with adjustments thereafter reflecting changes in reimbursement rates for school meals under the school lunch program.\n\nIf children are enrolled to receive free or reduced price meals under the school lunch or breakfast programs, they must be enrolled in this program without further application.\n\nSummer EBT cards may be used only to purchase food from retail food stores that have been approved for participation in the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program)."
