This bill requires each federal agency and federal court to accept, for any purpose for which an individual is required to provide an address to the agency or court, an address designated to that individual pursuant to an address confidentiality program. An individual who provides an address pursuant to such a program shall not be subject to any federal regulatory, civil, or criminal penalties for providing such address in lieu of the individual's actual physical address.

An address confidentiality program is a state-implemented program that provides a designated address in lieu of the individual's actual physical address to an individual who: (1) is determined to be at risk of being a victim of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, human trafficking, or stalking or who otherwise fears for their safety; or (2) resides in the same household as such an individual.

An agency or court seeking to acquire such individual's actual address shall comply with applicable procedures of such a program. Such address shall be considered confidential and shall not be subject to a Freedom of Information Act request.</summary>
