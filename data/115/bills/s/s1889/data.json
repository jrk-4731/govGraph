An individual who provides an address pursuant to such a program shall not be subject to any federal regulatory, civil, or criminal penalties for providing such address in lieu of the individual's actual physical address.\n\nAn address confidentiality program is a state-implemented program that provides a designated address in lieu of the individual's actual physical address to an individual who: (1) is determined to be at risk of being a victim of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, human trafficking, or stalking or who otherwise fears for their safety; or (2) resides in the same household as such an individual.\n\nAn agency or court seeking to acquire such individual's actual address shall comply with applicable procedures of such a program. Such address shall be considered confidential and shall not be subject to a Freedom of Information Act request."
