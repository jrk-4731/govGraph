The Farm Service Agency shall: (1) amend regulations under the emergency conservation program to increase the limit on payments to agricultural producers to $500,00 per natural disaster, and (2) initiate a rulemaking under such program to account for the challenges posed by the increase in frequency and intensity of wildland fires.

 The Natural Resources Conservation Service shall establish a two-year pilot program for the administration of the emergency watershed protection program in jurisdictions where a major wildfire disaster was declared

The President may provide hazard mitigation assistance in any area in which fire management assistance is provided.
