  <summary date="2017-09-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill provides temporary authority for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to appoint candidates directly to certain emergency response positions, in response to a critical hiring need.

 HHS must first provide public notice. It may appoint candidates without regard to certain requirements of the competitive rating and ranking process (e.g., application of veterans' preference points).</summary>
