The study must include the impacts on land in which the subsurface estate was conveyed to the CAC and the surface estate or a conservation easement in the surface estate was acquired by Alaska or by the United States as part of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council Habitat Protection and Acquisition Program.\n\nIn addition, the study must: (1) include recommendations for a land exchange, including land exchange options that could be offered to the CAC as consideration for the conveyance of its existing property rights in exchange for other federal land or property available for exchange; and (2)\u00a0identify at least 500,000 acres of economically viable federal land, in or outside of Alaska, that can be exchanged with the CAC. The land exchange described in the recommendations must be pursuant to mutual agreement of the CAC and the United States."
