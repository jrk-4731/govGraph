This bill directs the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to issue a final rule requiring the implementation of a national employer notification service that states may access. The term "employer notification service" means a service that automatically provides a report to an employer (with notice to the employee involved) on the change in the status of the driving record or license of an employee who has a commercial driver's license due to a conviction, license suspension or revocation, or any other action taken against the driving privilege.</summary>
