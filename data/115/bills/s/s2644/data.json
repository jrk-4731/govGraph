    "text": "Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal judicial code to codify certain Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations that govern the appointment, oversight, and removal of a special counsel, including regulations:\n\n that authorize the Attorney General to appoint and select a special counsel; that establish the qualifications, scope of jurisdiction, and authority of a special counsel; and that authorize the Attorney General to remove a special counsel for misconduct or other good cause. Additionally, the bill provides new statutory limitations and requirements with respect to the removal from office of a special counsel. Specifically, the bill:\n\n requires removal to be by the Attorney General or, in certain circumstances, the most senior Senate-confirmed DOJ official; requires a special counsel to be provided written notice that specifies the reason for removal; and allows a special counsel to challenge the removal in federal court. The limitations and requirements with respect to removal apply retroactively in the case of a special counsel who is appointed after January 1, 2017, and removed before the date of enactment.\n\nFinally, the bill requires DOJ to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed, before a special counsel is removed, and after a special counsel's investigation concludes."
