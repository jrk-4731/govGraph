The Department of Labor and the Department of Education must jointly establish grant programs for:\n\n individual support accounts to fund education and training costs that will prepare individuals in zones for long-term, high-wage employment; the development, revamping, improvement, or expansion of education and training programs for zones in in-demand industry sectors or occupations or industries in local demand; and programs for businesses to provide in-house training and future employment to individuals in zones."
