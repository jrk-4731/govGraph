In addition, the bill extends the hunting season for those birds by an extra weekend for youths, veterans, and members of the Armed Forces on active duty.\n\nThe Department of the Interior may not decrease the length of the hunting season or bag limit, as compared to the 2017-2018 hunting season, in the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, or Pacific flyway."
