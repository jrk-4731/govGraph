This bill amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to revise requirements for hunting ducks, mergansers, and coots. Specifically, the bill establishes January 31 of each year as the closing date of the hunting season for ducks, mergansers, and coots. In addition, the bill extends the hunting season for those birds by an extra weekend for youths, veterans, and members of the Armed Forces on active duty.

The Department of the Interior may not decrease the length of the hunting season or bag limit, as compared to the 2017-2018 hunting season, in the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, or Pacific flyway.</summary>
