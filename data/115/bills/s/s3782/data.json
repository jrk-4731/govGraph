This declaration does not apply to a contract, combination, or conspiracy to: (1) collect, compile, or disseminate historical loss data; (2) determine a loss development factor for historical loss data; (3) perform actuarial services if the collaboration does not involve a restraint of trade; or (4) develop or disseminate a standard insurance policy form if adherence to the form is not required.\n\nProhibitions against unfair methods of competition apply to the business of health insurance without regard to whether the business is for profit."
