These agreements must also provide training:\n\n through electronic resources, including Internet-based webinars; and at physical locations, including a small business development center (SBDC) and the headquarters or a regional office of the U.S.\u00a0Patent and Trademark Office. (Sec. 5) The bill amends the Small Business Act to require services at an SBDC to include training, in person or through a website, relating to:\n\n domestic and international intellectual property protections, and how those protections should be considered in the business plans and growth strategies of small businesses."
