(Sec. 4) This bill directs the Small Business Administration to develop partnership agreements that provide for:

 development of high-quality training for small businesses related to domestic and international protection of intellectual property, leveraging of training materials already developed for the education of inventors and small businesses, and participation of a nongovernmental organization. These agreements must also provide training:

 through electronic resources, including Internet-based webinars; and at physical locations, including a small business development center (SBDC) and the headquarters or a regional office of the U.S.&#160;Patent and Trademark Office. (Sec. 5) The bill amends the Small Business Act to require services at an SBDC to include training, in person or through a website, relating to:

 domestic and international intellectual property protections, and how those protections should be considered in the business plans and growth strategies of small businesses.</summary>
