This bill expands reporting requirements related to the ownership&#160;and investment interests of certain patient-advocacy organizations.

Under current law, a manufacturer of drugs, devices, or medical supplies that are covered under Medicaid or Medicare must regularly report on any payment or transfer of value by the manufacturer to a "covered recipient," defined as either a physician who is not an employee of the manufacturer or a teaching hospital. The bill expands the definition of "covered recipient," for purposes of this requirement, to also include patient-advocacy organizations that advocate on&#160;issues related to opioids. Furthermore, with respect to&#160;transfers of value to&#160;such organizations, the bill subjects not only manufacturers but also pharmaceutical trade associations to&#160;the reporting requirement.</summary>
