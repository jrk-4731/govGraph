The bill expands the definition of \"covered recipient,\" for purposes of this requirement, to also include patient-advocacy organizations that advocate on\u00a0issues related to opioids. Furthermore, with respect to\u00a0transfers of value to\u00a0such organizations, the bill subjects not only manufacturers but also pharmaceutical trade associations to\u00a0the reporting requirement."
