It shall complete research on equipping commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds with a front underride guard to prevent trucks from overriding the passenger vehicle and submit to the congressional transportation committees a report on such research.\n\nThe bill sets forth provisions regarding retrofit and maintenance requirements, and requires post-accident inspections and pre-trip inspections by drivers."
