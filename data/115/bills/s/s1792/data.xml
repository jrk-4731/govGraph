This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require the Department of Education to provide formula grants to states, Indian tribes, and territories for increasing the number of foster and homeless youth that apply and enroll in institutions of higher education (IHEs).

States that receive grants must use at least 70% of the grant funds to award subgrants to IHEs to enable the IHEs to become institutions of excellence by improving college access, retention, and completion rates for foster and homeless youth.</summary>
