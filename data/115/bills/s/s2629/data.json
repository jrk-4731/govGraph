All Medicare-eligible postal annuitants and employees enrolled in PSHBP must also enroll in Medicare, including parts A, B, and D.\n\nThe bill eliminates the existing statutory pension payment schedule, cancels any outstanding payments, and amortizes payments over 40 years.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS) may establish a program to enter into agreements with an agency of any state government, local government, or tribal government to provide property and services on behalf of such agencies for non-commercial products and services. Distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages shall be considered mailable if specified conditions apply.\n\nThe USPS shall submit to its Board of Governors: (1) a plan describing the actions it intends to take to achieve long-term solvency, and (2) a financial plan and budget consistent with that goal. The USPS must establish reasonable targets for performance to ensure that mail service for postal customers meets the service standards for market-dominant products.\n\nThere is established within USPS the position of Chief Innovation Officer. The USPS must submit to Congress and to the Postal Regulatory Commission a comprehensive strategy for maximizing revenues through innovative products and services.\n\nThe bill provides for emergency suspensions of post offices.\n\nThere is established in the USPS the Office of the Inspector General."
