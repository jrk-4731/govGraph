DHS, HHS, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) must provide apprehended parents or legal guardians separated from their children with written notice, in a language understandable to them, of any rules or guidance that may assist them in locating and reuniting with their children.\n\nThe bill permits DHS and HHS to use DNA testing to determine family relationships subject to certain requirements, after using other commonly-used techniques for determining such relationships.\n\nDHS must establish secure alternative programs that incorporate case management services in each DHS field office to ensure appearances by alien parents and children at immigration proceedings and public safety and to provide for community-based alternatives to detention.\n\nDHS, DOJ, and HHS shall establish an interagency Office for Locating and Reuniting Children with Parents for facilitating the reunification of children and apprehended parents or legal guardians after entering the United States."
