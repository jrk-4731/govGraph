  <summary date="2017-04-27T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2017

This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require each institution of higher education (IHE) to include in its annual security report a statement of policy regarding harassment that includes: (1) a prohibition of harassment of students by other students, faculty, and staff; (2) a description of its programs to prevent harassment; (3) a description of the procedures that students should follow if harassment occurs; and (4) a description of the procedures it will follow once an incident of harassment has been reported. In addition, the report must include a description of each occasion in which a pattern of harassment occurs and the actions taken by the IHE.

Harassment includes certain conduct undertaken through technological means that limits a student's ability to benefit from the IHE's programs, or creates a hostile or abusive educational environment at the school.

The Department of Education (ED) may award grants to IHEs to initiate, expand, or improve programs to: prevent the harassment of students; provide counseling or redress services to students who have been harassed or accused of subjecting other students to harassment; and train students, faculty, or staff to prevent harassment or address harassment if it occurs.

ED must publish a report of best practices for combating harassment at IHEs.</summary>
