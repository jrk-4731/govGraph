    "text": "Medicaid Third Party Liability Act\n\nThis bill alters provisions related to third-party liability for medical assistance paid under the Medicaid program. Specifically, with respect to such liability, the bill:\n\n expands the\u00a0definition of \"responsible third party\"\u00a0to include, among other health insurers,\u00a0the TRICARE program; eliminates special rules with respect to certain services provided to children; requires the inclusion, in a contract between a state Medicaid program and a health insurer, of\u00a0certain information regarding whether the state is delegating or transferring to the\u00a0insurer a right of\u00a0third-party recovery;\u00a0 provides for the treatment as overpayment of reimbursements made by a responsible third party to a health insurer; disallows a responsible third party from denying a state's claim solely on the basis of a failure to obtain a prior authorization;\u00a0 imposes a timeline for a responsible third party to respond to a state's inquiry regarding a claim for payment; provides for reductions to a state Medicaid program's federal matching rate\u00a0if the state\u00a0fails to comply with third-party insurance requirements; and modifies other provisions related to third-party liability under the Medicaid program. Third-party liability requirements applicable\u00a0under Medicaid\u00a0shall also apply\u00a0under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0must:\n\n publish on its website, and annually update, best practices for assessing third-party liability; monitor and analyze efforts to assess that liability; in consultation with states, develop and make available a model uniform reporting field for identifying information related to responsible third parties; and provide other specified information and guidance to states."
