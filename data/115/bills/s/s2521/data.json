An extreme risk protection order is a federal court order that prohibits a person from owning, possessing, receiving, or having control or custody of a firearm.\n\nThe bill also expands the categories of prohibited persons (i.e., persons barred from receiving or possessing a firearm or ammunition) to add a new category for persons who are subject to a court order that prohibits them from purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm."
