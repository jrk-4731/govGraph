The bill provides a mechanism for states to receive their entitled percentage of sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals for all public land or deposits located in the state.\n\nCertain oil and gas activities conducted on non-federal surface estates do not require a permit.\n\nThe Department of the Interior must defer to state regulations, guidance, and permit requirements for all activities regarding hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on federal land."
