This bill provides that when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) brings a major adverse action against certain Veterans Health Administration medical employees the VA shall transmit to the National Practitioner Data Bank and the applicable state licensing board the employee's name and the reason for such action.

The VA may not enter into a settlement agreement regarding a claim by a VA employee under which it would be required to conceal a serious medical error or purge a negative record from an employee's personnel file. Such provision shall not apply to a negative record if the VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection and the Office of Special Counsel jointly certify that the negative record is not legitimate.</summary>
