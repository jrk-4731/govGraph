The state making an election shall:\n\n agree to maintain the Interstate System in accordance with the current Interstate System program; submit a plan describing the purposes, projects, and uses to which such amounts will be put and the federal-aid highway programmatic requirements the state elects to continue; agree to obligate or expend program amounts exclusively for projects that would be eligible for surface transportation program funding; and. agree to report annually to DOT on the use of amounts received under the program and to make the report publicly available. DOT shall carry out a similar alternative funding program for public transportation programs."
