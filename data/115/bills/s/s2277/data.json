    "text": "This bill requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to determine whether a population of at least 100 Mexican gray wolves in a 5,000-square-mile area within the historic range of the Mexican gray wolf has been established, as described in the Mexican Wolf Recovery Plan of 1982. The term Mexican gray wolf includes any gray wolf that the USFWS determines will take the place of, or correspond with, the Mexican gray wolf.\n\nIf the USFWS makes a determination that the population has been established, then: (1) the Mexican gray wolf shall be excluded from a list of endangered species, threatened species, or experimental populations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; and (2) the management of the Mexican gray wolf must be assumed by each state in which the wolf is present."
