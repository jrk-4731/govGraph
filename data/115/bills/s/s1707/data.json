If the monthly costs are greater than the sum of the standard medical deduction and $35, the household may deduct the actual costs.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) may approve a standard medical deduction that is higher than the amount required by this bill.\n\nUSDA must submit specified studies and reports to Congress regarding: (1) state performance in enrolling disabled and elderly individuals in SNAP and specified Medicare programs, (2) disability and food insecurity, and (3) the effectiveness of the standard medical deduction."
