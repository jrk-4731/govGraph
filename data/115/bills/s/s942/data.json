    "text": "Counterterrorism Screening and Assistance Act of 2017\n\nThis bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. government must ensure that capacity-building assistance to combat terrorist travel is coordinated among agencies as well as with foreign implementing partners, and (2) such assistance should be prioritized for the highest-risk countries for travel by terrorists and foreign fighters.\n\nThe Department of State shall submit to Congress biennially a foreign partner engagement plan that catalogues existing capacity-building initiatives abroad to combat travel by terrorists and foreign fighters and identifies areas for adjustment to align efforts with risk-based priorities.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the State Department shall provide appropriate versions of the following systems to foreign governments:\n\n U.S. Customs and Border Protection's global travel targeting and analysis systems; and the State Department's watchlisting, identification, and screening systems. DHS may provide, with specified exceptions, excess DHS nonlethal equipment and supplies (as well as related training) to a foreign government if such action would:\n\n further U.S. homeland security interests; and enhance the recipient government's capacity to mitigate the threat of terrorism, infectious disease or natural disaster, protect lawful trade and travel, or enforce intellectual property rights. DHS shall notify Congress before providing such systems, equipment, or supplies.\n\nThe State Department: (1) shall report to Congress annually through 2022 on foreign government efforts to combat terrorist and foreign fighter travel and on U.S. actions to help countries comply with minimum standards for such efforts, and (2) may suspend non-humanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance to a country that is not making significant efforts to comply with such minimum standards."
