This bill amends the federal criminal code to make trafficking in firearms a stand-alone criminal offense.

A person who commits or conspires to commit a gun trafficking offense is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a prison term of up to 20 years (or up to 25 years, if the person also acted as an organizer), a fine, or both.&#160; The U.S. Sentencing Commission must review and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines and policy statements that apply to persons convicted of trafficking in firearms.</summary>
