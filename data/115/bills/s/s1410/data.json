The bill permits the operation of unmanned aircraft (i.e., drones) without specific operating authority from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) if specified conditions apply, such as if the aircraft is flown strictly for hobby or recreational use.\n\nThe FAA shall: (1) initiate a process to periodically update the operational parameters for drones, and (2) maintain on its website a list of community-based organizations under which small drones may be operated.\n\nThe bill requires the Government Accountability Office to report on developments and protections relating to cybersecurity and operational control concerns with respect to drones."
