 This bill directs the Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations that require each covered air carrier to: (1) ensure that the purchase of an airline ticket guarantees transportation of the passenger to the advertised destination (subject to reasons prohibiting a passenger from flying as established by the Federal Aviation Administration or any other federal agency); and (2) provide each passenger with alternative transportation to the advertised destination at no additional expense and in a reasonable and timely manner, if the carrier cancels a flight.</summary>
