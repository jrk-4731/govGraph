    "text": "National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to reauthorize through FY2023 and revise the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n\nA community that participates in NFIP and has been repeatedly flooded must: (1) assess the continuing risks to community areas repeatedly damaged by floods; and (2) develop and implement\u00a0a publicly available, community-specific plan for mitigating continuing flood risks to such areas. A community that does not comply with these requirements shall be subject to sanctions.\n\nThe amount of coverage available under the Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) program is increased. This bill makes available ICC coverage in communities outside special flood hazard areas that have adopted specified land use and control measures.\n\nAfter FY2021, as a condition of qualifying for NFIP, local or state governments are required to impose upon a seller or lessor a duty to disclose specified flood information.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must incorporate the replacement value of structures in setting flood premium rates.\n\nThis bill amends the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 to reauthorize through FY2023 and revise the mapping program.\n\n In addition to reinsurance, alternatives may be used by FEMA in its risk transfer activities.\n\nThis bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to provide procedures for the declaration of a major disaster for wildfire on federal land."
