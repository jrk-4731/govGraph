This bill includes veterans who participated in the cleanup of radioactive materials at Palomares, Spain, from January 17, 1966 through March 31, 1967, as radiation exposed veterans for purposes of the Department of Veterans Affairs presumption of service-connection for specified cancers and other radiogenic disorders.

Under a presumption of service-connection, specific disabilities diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded.</summary>
