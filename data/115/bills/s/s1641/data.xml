This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) to prohibit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from taking administrative action to recover any payment for disaster or emergency assistance that is made three years after a completed disaster relief project where the project grantee certifies that the purpose of the grant was accomplished. Under current law, FEMA may initiate an action to recover assistance payments for up to three years after the transmission of a final expenditure report for a disaster or emergency.

Additionally, the bill prohibits FEMA from taking any action to recoup certain assistance under the Stafford Act provided to individuals and households (relating to a major disaster declared on or after January 1, 2012), if the receipt of such assistance occurred more than three years before FEMA first provided written notification of an intent to recoup such assistance.</summary>
