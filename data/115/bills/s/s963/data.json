In carrying out\u00a0these agreements, Treasury must consult with the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Partnerships and the\u00a0Commission on Social Impact Partnerships (both newly established by\u00a0the bill). Treasury may transfer to another federal agency the authority to administer\u00a0the agreements.\n\nAt least 50% of all federal payments made\u00a0under such agreements must be used for initiatives that directly benefit children.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall evaluate, and report to Congress on, social-impact partnerships funded under the bill."
