  <summary date="2017-11-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">LGBT Elder Americans Act of 2017

This bill amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to include the specific needs of&#160;lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals among the "greatest social needs" served under that Act. An LGBT individual shall be considered a "minority" for purposes of services provided under the Act.

The bill authorizes the Administration of Aging to designate within it a person with responsibility for addressing issues affecting LGBT older individuals. In addition, the administration shall conduct studies and collect data to determine the services needed by LGBT older individuals.&#160;

The administration&#160;shall&#160;establish and operate the National Resource Center on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Aging to provide national, state, and local organizations with the information and technical assistance needed by those organizations to effectively serve LGBT older individuals.

The&#160;Long-Term Care Ombudsman of each state shall, as a condition of receiving certain federal funding under the Act,&#160; collect and analyze data related to discrimination against LGBT older individuals in long-term care settings.</summary>
