Property acquired for a project must be open to the public for compatible fish and wildlife-dependent recreation and be closed only to protect public safety, the property, or the habitat.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) must establish the National Fish Habitat Conservation Partnership Program with duties to include providing funding for the operational needs of the Fish Habitat Partnerships.\n\nThe USFWS, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Geological Survey must provide technical and scientific assistance to the partnerships, the project participants, and the board.The bill permits the head of each federal agency to coordinate with NOAA and the USFWS to promote healthy fish populations and fish habitats.\n\n Any funds made available to carry out this bill may not be used for fish and wildlife mitigation purposes under any federal law or court settlement."
