The IRS must maintain a program that provides free tax preparation and electronic filing services to low-income and elderly taxpayers.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 to require at least one IRS appeals officer and one settlement officer to be located and permanently available in each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico."
