Specifically, an individual shall be deemed to have been paid a wage (according to a specified formula) during each month in which the individual was engaged for at least 80 hours in providing care to a dependent relative without monetary compensation. However, this requirement\u00a0shall not apply if a larger benefit or payment would otherwise be payable.\n\nThe bill also authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to support state programs that provide medical training to individuals who provide care to dependent relatives without monetary compensation."
