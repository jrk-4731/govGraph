This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE)to enter into an arrangement under which the National Academy of Sciences must conduct a study to determine whether opportunities exist for affected communities to consider alternatives to nuclear facilities, generating sites, and waste sites. DOE must also: (1) establish the Stranded Nuclear Waste Task Force to study existing public and private resources and funding for affected communities, and (2) establish a grant program to assist localities near nuclear power plants to offset the impacts of stranded nuclear waste in affected communities.

The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for tax incentives for investment in nuclear affected communities.</summary>
