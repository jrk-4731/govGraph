This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) expand nonimmigrant employer annual data reporting requirements to include all nonimmigrant worker categories and compensated cultural exchange, training, and business classifications; and (2) require that such information be made public. (Employment means employment in the United States and includes cultural exchanges, training, or business activities for which the nonimmigrant receives any form of compensation.)

Expanded reporting requirements shall include information regarding: (1) age and gender of admitted nonimmigrants, (2) categories and numbers of visas issued and numbers of persons admitted under each visa, (4) blanket petitions, (5) nonimmigrant worker employers, and (6) citizens of nations with Compacts of Free Association with the United States who are authorized to reside permanently in the United States as nonimmigrants.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State, and the Department of Labor may revise forms or databases used to regulate nonimmigrant visas or grant nonimmigrant status.

The State Department and Labor shall share report-related information with DHS.</summary>
