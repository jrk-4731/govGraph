(Sec. 5) The Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee must expand to include a senior official from the State Department and from the Department of the Interior.\n\n(Sec. 6) This bill reauthorizes for FY2018-FY2022: (1) the Marine Debris Program, (2) an information clearinghouse on marine debris, and (3) enforcement of laws about discarded marine debris from ships."
