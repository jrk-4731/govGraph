This bill prohibits the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from: (1) hiring or transferring to any VA position a person who has been convicted of a state or federal criminal offense that substantially relates to the position and for which the minimum prison term is more than one year; or (2) employing a person in a VA position who, after enactment of this bill, is convicted of such a criminal offense.

Such prohibition shall not apply:

 to a conviction of a state or federal criminal offense if the records of such conviction have been expunged, to a conviction of a state or federal criminal offense if during the 10-year period beginning on the date of such conviction the person has not been convicted of any other criminal offense for which the minimum prison term is more than one year, or if the person is being hired or transferred as part of a program to help veterans who have been convicted of a state or federal criminal offense for which the minimum prison term is more than one year. The VA: (1) may not employ, transfer, or hire an individual for specified medical positions who has had a related license or credential revoked or suspended; and (2) shall begin the process of terminating current employees who have had such licenses or credentials revoked or suspended.

The Merit Systems Protection Board shall issue a decision on an appeal for termination review within 30 days of an employee's notification of termination.

The VA shall provide information about an individual's disciplinary action to the appropriate state medical licensing boards and to the National Practitioner Databank.</summary>
