This bill establishes the Emerging Technology Policy Lab within the General Services Administration (GSA) to

 advise and promote the efforts of the federal government in ensuring that the use of emerging technologies by the government, including artificial intelligence, is in the best interest of the public; and improve cohesion and competency in federal agency rule making and the use of emerging technologies. In addition, the Office of Personnel Management must

 identify key skills and competencies needed for positions related to artificial intelligence; and establish an occupational series, or revise an existing occupational job series, to include positions the primary duties of which relate to artificial intelligence.</summary>
