(Sec. 2) This bill requires a federal agency that creates or conducts a redesign of a website that is intended for use by the public, to ensure that the website is mobile friendly.

 "Mobile friendly" means that the website is configured in such a way that it may be navigated, viewed, and accessed on a smartphone, tablet computer, or similar mobile device.

The Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration must report to Congress describing the implementation of, and assessing the compliance of each agency with, such requirement.</summary>
