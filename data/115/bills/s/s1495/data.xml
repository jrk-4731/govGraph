  <summary date="2017-06-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">ANCSA Fractional Shares Consolidation Act of 2017

This bill amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to allow Alaska Native regional corporations to issue a full share of any class of stock, for no consideration, in exchange for a fractional share of the same class of stock, held by any shareholder, as long as the corporation exchanges all fractional shares of a class of stock for full shares at the same time.

After converting fractional shares of stock to full shares, a corporation may adopt a policy that provides for the elimination of fractional shares.</summary>
