Sensitive PII is information that identifies a particular person, including electronic or digital forms of personal, financial, health, and biometric data, geographic location, and password-protected photographs and videos.\n\nIt establishes civil penalties for violations and authorizes DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission, and states to enforce compliance."
