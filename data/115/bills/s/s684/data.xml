This bill amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a demonstration program through which each participating state or Indian tribe: (1) adopts the uniform, research-based home study methodology developed by HHS&#160;for the evaluation of prospective foster parents and adoptive parents; and (2) provides data gathered through operation of the program&#160;to HHS, as HHS may require for purposes of the national database established by this bill.

HHS shall: (1) &#160;make grants to states and Indian tribes to enable and encourage them to establish demonstration programs, (2) establish a secure national database of home study reports, and (3) contract with an independent entity to carry out a periodic evaluation of the home study methodology developed by HHS and the demonstration programs.</summary>
