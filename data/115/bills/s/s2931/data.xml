This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop national milestones to measure progress in reducing the opioid epidemic over a five-year period based on certain metrics, such as opioid-related overdoses, emergency room visits, and treatment admissions. HHS must submit annual reports and status updates, including evaluations of federal programs that are intended to address the opioid epidemic.</summary>
