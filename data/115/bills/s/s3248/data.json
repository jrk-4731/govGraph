Treasury may waive the IFC restriction for projects to diversify Turkey's energy resources and lessen its dependence on Russian or Iranian oil or gas.\n\nSuch restrictions:\n\n shall terminate after the President certifies to Congress that Turkey is no longer arbitrarily detaining or denying freedom of movement to U.S. citizens (including dual citizens) or locally employed staff of the U.S. mission to Turkey, and shall not apply to loans or financial or technical assistance for humanitarian purposes."
