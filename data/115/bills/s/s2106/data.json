Such states that do not implement automatic registration must permit eligible individuals to register to vote and vote on the day of a federal election.\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission shall make grants to states to implement automatic voter registration and improve election security systems related to voter registration.\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is amended to revise the procedure for voting following a registered voter's failure to return a change of address card."
