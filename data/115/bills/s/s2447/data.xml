  <summary date="2018-02-15T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Smart Building Acceleration Act

This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a Federal Smart Building Program to implement smart building technology in certain federal buildings and demonstrate the costs and benefits of smart buildings. Smart buildings are buildings with energy systems that: (1) are flexible and automated; (2) have extensive operational monitoring and communication connectivity, allowing remote monitoring and analysis of building functions; (3) take a systems-based approach in integrating the overall building operations for control of energy generation, consumption, and storage; (4) communicate with utilities and other third-party commercial entities, if appropriate; (5) protect the health and safety of occupants and workers; and (6) are cybersecure.

DOE may expand awards made under the Federal Energy Management Program and the Better Building Challenge to recognize specific federal agency achievements in accelerating the adoption of smart building technologies.

DOE must conduct a survey of privately owned smart buildings throughout the United States and evaluate their costs and benefits.

As part of the Better Building Challenge, DOE must demonstrate policies and approaches that accelerate the transition to smart buildings. DOE must conduct research and development on barriers to the integration of advanced building technologies.</summary>
