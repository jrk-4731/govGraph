    "text": "Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2017\n\nThis bill reauthorizes the Office of National Drug Control Policy through FY2023. It amends the definition of \"demand reduction\" in a National Drug Control Program to include screenings, interventions, promoting availability of and access to health care services, and support for long-term recovery from substance abuse disorders. It defines \"illicit drug use,\" \"illegal drug use,\" and like terms to include the illegal use of prescription drugs.\n\nThe Director of the National Drug Control Policy (Director) shall be directly responsible for demand reduction activities, supply reduction activities, and for state, local, and tribal affairs.\n\nThe Director shall require each National Drug Control Program agency to submit to the Director on an annual basis an evaluation of progress by the agency regarding implementation of drug recovery programs. The Director shall also ensure that drug recovery research is effectively disseminated by the National Drug Control Program agencies to state and local governments and nongovernmental agencies involved in demand reduction.\n\nThe President shall submit to Congress a National Drug Control Strategy, which shall set forth a comprehensive plan for the year to reduce illicit drug use and the consequences of such use by promoting prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support for individuals with substance abuse disorders.\n\nThe Director shall submit to Congress a report evaluating high intensity drug trafficking areas (HIDTAs) as part of the National Drug Control Strategy, assessing drug enforcement task forces in HIDTAs, and assessing law enforcement intelligence sharing in HIDTAs."
