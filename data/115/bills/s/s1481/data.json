    "text": "Alaska Native Claims Settlement Improvement Act of 2017\n\nThis bill revises provisions concerning Alaska Natives claims to land and Alaska Native regional, village, or urban corporations.\n\nThe bill amends the Barrow Gas Field Transfer Act of 1984 to require the Department of the Interior to convey to the Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation certain sand and gravel deposits.\n\n Interior must grant the Shishmaref Native Corporation a transportation easement.\n\nShee Atika Incorporated may opt to receive credits from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the sale of Cube Cove in Admiralty Island, Alaska, that may be used to acquire federal property sold at public sales.\n\nThe bill authorizes a land exchange between the USDA and the Sealaska Corporation.\n\nCook Inlet Region, Inc. may satisfy its land claim under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).\n\nInterior must convey a surface estate to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, a subsurface estate to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, a surface estate to Kian Tr'ee Corporation, and a subsurface estate to Doyon Limited.\n\nThe bill amends ANCSA to require Interior to pay compensation to Nagamut Limited and the Calista Corporation in lieu of conveying land to Nagamut and a subsurface estate to Calista.\n\nNative residents of the villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell, Alaska, may organize as urban corporations. Upon incorporation, Interior must offer each corporation 23,040 acres of land.\n\nAlaska Native veterans who served during the Vietnam War may receive an allotment of federal land.\n\nFor purposes of determining eligibility for need-based federal programs, the amount of cash an Alaska Native receives from a Native corporation that is disregarded is increased.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, Alaska Native village corporations may reincorporate after they are involuntarily dissolved."
