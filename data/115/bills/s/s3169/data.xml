This bill states that unless the President determines and informs Congress that Russia is not in material compliance with New START, it is U.S. policy to extend New START from its initial termination date in February 2021 to February 2026, as allowed in the Treaty. (New START is the popular name of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed April 8, 2010, and entered into force February 5, 2011.)</summary>
