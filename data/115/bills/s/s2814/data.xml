  <summary date="2018-05-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">New Markets for State-Inspected Meat and Poultry Act of 2018 

This bill allows meat and poultry products inspected by State Meat and Poultry Inspection programs to be sold in interstate commerce. (Under the inspection programs, the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service allows states that meet certain requirements to inspect meat and poultry. The state-inspected products are currently limited to intrastate commerce, unless a state opts into a separate Cooperative Interstate Shipment Program.)</summary>
