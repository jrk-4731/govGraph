This bill modifies provisions regarding the coordination and assessment of U.S. public diplomacy efforts.

The&#160;bill permanently reauthorizes the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, which assesses U.S. public diplomacy efforts. Currently, the commission's authorization expires after FY2020.

The&#160;bill directs the Department of State to research and report on ways to improve U.S. public diplomacy and reduce duplicated efforts. It creates a director of research and evaluation position within the State Department's Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs to oversee this research.

The bill also restructures the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. (The board advises the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the body that oversees U.S. government media outlets abroad such as Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.)</summary>
