The fair market value of in-kind-gifts is included in such limit. (Currently, a report is due if the annual value is $250,000 or more, considered alone or in combination with all other gifts from or contracts with a foreign source.)\n\nA report shall: (1) include the contents of any such contracts, and (2) make such contents available for public disclosure."
