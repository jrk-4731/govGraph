  <summary date="2018-03-21T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Foreign Influence Transparency Act

This bill amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 to limit the exemption from foreign agent registration with the Department of Justice for a person engaging in activities in furtherance of religious, scholastic, academic, or scientific pursuits or of the fine arts to only those activities that do not promote a foreign government's political agenda.

 The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require institutions to report to the Department of Education a gift or contract from a foreign source whose annual value is $50,000 or more. The fair market value of in-kind-gifts is included in such limit. (Currently, a report is due if the annual value is $250,000 or more, considered alone or in combination with all other gifts from or contracts with a foreign source.)

A report shall: (1) include the contents of any such contracts, and (2) make such contents available for public disclosure.</summary>
