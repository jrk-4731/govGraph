  <summary date="2018-10-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to issue emergency payments to dairy producers. USDA must develop criteria for the payments that give priority to producers who are: (1) located in a state with a high cost of dairy production compared to other states, and (2) on a farm with a high cost of dairy production based on the size of the farm.

The emergency payments provided under this bill must be at least $10,000 but no greater than $20,000 per dairy operation.

USDA must use $556 million in Commodity Credit Corporation funds to carry out this bill. The bill designates the spending as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010 and the FY2018 congressional budget resolution. (This exempts the spending from various budget enforcement rules.)</summary>
