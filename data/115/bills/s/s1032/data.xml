This bill amends the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 to authorize the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to enter into good neighbor agreements with states to carry out specified similar and complementary forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration services on certain National Forest System (NFS) lands.

The bill makes requirements under the National Forest Management Act of 1976 regarding the advertisement of timber sales on NFS lands and the designation and supervision of the harvesting of trees, portions of trees, or forest products on NFS lands inapplicable to the restoration services authorized by this bill.

USDA shall provide or approve all silviculture prescriptions and marking guides to be applied on NSF land in any timber sales project conducted pursuant to this bill.

Any decision required to be made by USDA under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 concerning any such services shall not be delegated to any state.</summary>
