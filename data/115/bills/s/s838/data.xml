This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to extend that Act's requirements to real property retrofit loans. A "real property retrofit loan" is a loan that is: (1) secured by an interest in real property; (2) repayable in installment payments made concurrently with the payment of property taxes on the real property; and (3) used to finance real property retrofits, including energy-efficiency upgrades, renewable-energy installations, seismic retrofits, water-conservation upgrades, and other similar improvements.

Before extending&#160;a real property retrofit loan, the creditor must disclose that the loan will result in a lien on the real property securing the loan.</summary>
