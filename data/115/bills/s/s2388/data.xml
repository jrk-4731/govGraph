  <summary date="2018-02-07T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2018

This bill amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to require a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensee to submit to the NRC a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report (PSDAR) regarding the shutdown of a nuclear facility. Prior to submitting a PSDAR, a licensee must consult with affected states and localities.

In the state where the nuclear facility is located, the NRC is required to: (1) solicit public comments on a proposed PSDAR; (2) conduct at least two public hearings; and (3) invite the state to file a statement of support, nonsupport, or conditional support for the proposed PSDAR with specific recommendations that could lead to support.

The NRC must determine the adequacy or inadequacy of a proposed PSDAR and issue a decision document accordingly.</summary>
