The term \"covered small business concerns\" means:\n\n HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, small business concerns owned and controlled by women, and socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns receiving SBA procurement contracts. In making such determinations, the SBA shall use information from multiple award contracts: (1) with varied assigned North American Industry Classification System codes, and (2) that were awarded by at least eight federal agencies."
