A \"farm to food bank program\" is a program under which agricultural producers donate food products to a food bank, an association of food banks, or a food assistance network for free distribution to individuals in need.\n\nThe bill also amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to require the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to establish a procedure under which an insured crop that is donated by a producer does not qualify as a produced crop under a crop insurance claim.\n\nUSDA must coordinate with the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study to evaluate and determine methods of measuring food waste, standards for the volume of food waste, and causal factors for food waste."
