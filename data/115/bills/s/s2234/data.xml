  <summary date="2017-12-14T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Internet of Things Consumer Tips to Improve Personal Security Act of 2017 or the IOT Consumer TIPS Act of 2017

This bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)&#160;in coordination with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and relevant private sector stakeholders and experts&#160;to develop voluntary educational cybersecurity resources for consumers relating to the&#160;protection and use of the Internet of Things (devices, applications, and physical objects that are Internet-enabled, networked, or connected).

The resources must be technology-neutral and include guidance, best practices, and advice for consumers to protect against, mitigate, and recover from cybersecurity threats or security vulnerabilities.

The resources do not bind the FTC to any particular guidance, best practice, or advice. The FTC may not base an enforcement action on any failure to promote or use such guidance, best practice, or advice unless such practice violates another provision of law.</summary>
