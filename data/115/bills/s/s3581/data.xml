  <summary date="2018-10-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Digital Goods and Services Tax Fairness Act of 2018

This bill prohibits a state or local jurisdiction from imposing: (1) multiple taxes on the sale of a covered electronic good or service, or (2) discriminatory taxes on the sale or use of a digital good or service.

A "digital good or service" is delivered or transferred electronically to a customer. A "covered electronic good or service" is a digital good, digital service, audio or video programming service, or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service.

The bill also:

 specifies services that are excluded from the definition of "digital service;" restricts taxation of a covered electronic good or service to taxation by a state or local jurisdiction whose territorial limits encompass a customer tax address, as defined by this bill; makes the seller of covered electronic goods or services responsible for obtaining and maintaining such address; and specifies rules regarding the taxation of bundled transactions, digital code, and VoIP services.</summary>
