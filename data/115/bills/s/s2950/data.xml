This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit&#160;of up to $100,000 for 25% of the&#160;franchise fees paid or incurred by a veteran&#160;for the purchase of a franchise. The bill reduces the amount of such credit if the veteran does not own 100% of the stock or of the capital or profits interest of the franchisee.

The veteran may elect to transfer the credit to a franchisor in exchange for a discount in the franchise fee commensurate with the value of the credit.

 The Small Business Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide information about the tax credit allowed by this bill to veterans service organizations and veteran advocacy groups.</summary>
