Commerce shall make such designations for a two-year period, and may renew a designation for additional two-year periods, based on specified criteria.\n\n Recipients may use such financial or technical assistance to support investments in ecosystems that will improve the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, including:\n\n infrastructure; access to capital; promotion of exports and foreign direct investment; equipment or facility upgrades; workforce training, retraining, or recruitment and retention, including that of women and underrepresented minorities; energy or process efficiency; business incubators; site preparation; advanced research; supply chain development; and small business assistance."
