    "text": "Solution for Undocumented Children through Careers, Employment, Education, and Defending our Nation Act or the SUCCEED Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to cancel the removal of otherwise inadmissible or deportable aliens who entered the United States as children and grant them conditional permanent resident status. The conditional permanent resident status of such aliens shall be valid for an initial period of five years if they came to the United States before the age of 16 and have lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2012. Such aliens must demonstrate that they were younger than age 31 on June 15, 2012, and had no lawful status in the United States.\n\nThe bill imposes other requirements upon such aliens, including educational attainments, good moral character, lack of criminal history, and compliance with tax responsibilities. The bill extends conditional permanent resident status for an additional five years if an alien continues to show good moral character, has no tax liabilities, is not receiving federal benefits, has graduated from college or attended a postsecondary school, or has served in the military.\n\nThe bill permits alien children to apply for the removal of conditional status after 10 years and adjust to lawful permanent residence upon a showing that they have been a conditional permanent resident for at least 10 years, have demonstrated good moral character during that period, have met other age and residency requirement, and have not abandoned residence in the United States. An alien may apply for naturalization five years after adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence under the terms of this bill.\n\nAliens who violate the requirements of this bill or commit certain crimes are subject to expedited removal without an immigration court hearing.\n\nAliens with conditional or lawful permanent resident status under this bill may not sponsor family members, including spouses and children, to obtain legal status in the United States."
