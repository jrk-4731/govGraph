  <summary date="2018-07-18T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Energy Security Cooperation with Allied Partners in Europe Act of 2018

This bill urges the President to direct the U.S. Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to encourage NATO member states to work together to achieve energy security.

The Department of State shall submit to Congress a transatlantic energy strategy to enhance the energy security of NATO member and partner countries and to increase U.S. energy exports to such countries.

The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite approvals of natural gas exports to NATO allies, Japan (as long as the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security remains in effect), and any other foreign country where natural gas exports would promote U.S. national security interests.

The President shall impose five or more specified sanctions against a person that knowingly makes certain investments that contribute to Russia's ability to construct energy export pipelines or sells, leases, or provides Russia with related goods, services, technology, or information.</summary>
