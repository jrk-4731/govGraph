This bill amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to revise financial disclosure requirements for federal personnel, including: (1) the disclosure of contributions made or solicited by, or on behalf of, individuals nominated or appointed to high level executive positions or to positions of a confidential or policymaking character to political organizations or tax exempt social welfare or business organizations; and (2) the disclosure of certain gifts to appointees, their spouses, or dependent children.

The Office of Government Ethics shall, upon request, provide to the Chairman or Ranking Member of a House or Senate committee or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the agency to which an individual has been nominated for appointment to a covered position (certain Executive Schedule or Senior Executive Service positions) or is serving in a covered position, each financial disclosure report filed by such individual and any ethics agreement entered into between the agency and the individual.

The office shall issue rules on how an executive branch agency shall address conflicts of interest identified in disclosures through ethics agreements between the agency and its appointees.</summary>
