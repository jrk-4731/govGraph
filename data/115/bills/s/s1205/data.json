An American dream account is a personal online account for low-income students that: (1) monitors their progress toward higher education; (2) includes a college savings account; and (3) provides students with opportunities to attain financial literacy, learn about preparing for enrollment in an institute of higher education (IHE), and identify their skills or interests."
