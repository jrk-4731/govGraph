  <summary date="2017-05-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">American Dream Accounts Act

This bill authorizes the Department of Education to award competitive grants to eligible entities for establishing and administering American Dream Accounts for a group of at least 30 low-income public school students who, at the time of the grant application, are attending a grade no higher than ninth grade. An American dream account is a personal online account for low-income students that: (1) monitors their progress toward higher education; (2) includes a college savings account; and (3) provides students with opportunities to attain financial literacy, learn about preparing for enrollment in an institute of higher education (IHE), and identify their skills or interests.</summary>
