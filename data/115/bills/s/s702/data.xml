This bill amends the National Labor Relations Act to make it an unlawful labor practice for a labor organization or its agents while representing, or seeking to represent, employees engaged in maritime employment to engage in a labor slowdown at any time, including when a collective-bargaining agreement is in effect.

The bill amends the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 to allow a party injured by a labor slowdown to recover two times the amount of damages sustained and reasonable attorney fees and expert witness fees.</summary>
