Through the Coast Guard, DHS must also:\n\n direct each Area Maritime Security Advisory Committee to facilitate the sharing of information about, and development of plans to address, port-specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities; and\u00a0 require that area maritime security plans and facility security plans approved after enactment of this bill\u00a0include mitigation measures to prevent, manage, and respond to cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The bill amends the federal shipping codes to include cybersecurity in facility and vessel vulnerability assessments."
