This bill amends the National Apprenticeship Act to direct Department of Labor State Apprenticeship agencies to act on an apprenticeship application within 90 days after an application is submitted. If the apprenticeship agency cannot make a decision on an application with that time period, the application must be forwarded to Labor. The bill would then grant Labor 30 days to make a final determination or the application would be automatically approved..</summary>
