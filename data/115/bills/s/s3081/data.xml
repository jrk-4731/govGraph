This bill amends the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to direct the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to enable institutions of higher education or other entities that provide state-recognized elementary and secondary school counseling credentials to:

 consult with state or local boards to assess local and regional employment needs and trends; develop best practices for training school counselors to provide&#160;career counseling based on those trends; and&#160; implement curricula, training modules, or materials to train school counselors based on those best practices. ED shall publish and disseminate the best practices.

The Government Accountability Office shall report on school counselor certification requirements and&#160;the impact of those requirements on the availability of effective&#160;career counseling.</summary>
