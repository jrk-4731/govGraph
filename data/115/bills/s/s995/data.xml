This bill establishes the Spokane Tribe of Indians Recovery Trust Fund to compensate the Spokane Business Council for the use of tribal lands for the generation of hydropower from the Grand Coulee Dam.

The council must prepare a plan for the use of those payments to promote any combination of: (1) economic development; (2) infrastructure development; or (3) educational, health, recreational, and social welfare objectives of the tribe and its members.

The Bonneville Power Administration must make specified settlement payments to the tribe.

Payments made to the council or tribe may be used or invested by the council in the same manner as other tribal governmental funds.

Deposit of amounts in the fund extinguishes all monetary claims that the tribe may have against the United States to a fair share of the annual hydropower revenues generated by the Grand Coulee Dam.</summary>
