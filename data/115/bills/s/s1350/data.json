A hearing must be non-adversarial and the hearing officer must identify any relevant and material pre-election issues and create a full record.\n\nThe bill requires the NLRB, in cases where it finds that a question of representation affecting commerce exists, to: (1) direct an election by secret ballot as soon as practicable but not before 35 calendar days after the filing of an election petition, and (2) certify election results after it has ruled on each pre-election issue not resolved before the election and any additional issue pertaining to the conduct or results of that election.\n\nThe bill also requires the NLRB, not earlier than seven days after a final determination of the appropriate bargaining unit, to acquire from the employer a list of all employees eligible to vote in the election, which shall: (1) be made available to all parties; and (2) include the employees' names and one additional form of personal contact information (e.g., telephone number, email address, or mailing address) chosen by the employee in writing."
