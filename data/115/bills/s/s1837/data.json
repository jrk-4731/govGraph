The bill also specifies that such products must be taxed at a level equivalent to the rate for cigarettes on an estimated per use basis.\n\nThe bill also makes smokeless tobacco products\u00a0sold in discrete single-use units subject to an excise tax of $50.33 per thousand.\n\nThe tax rates for tobacco products must be adjusted for inflation after 2017."
