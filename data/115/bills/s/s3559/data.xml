This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) terminate and repeal the tax credit for new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles, (2) impose a user fee on alternative fuel vehicles used in the United States, and (3) require the user fees to be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund.

"Alternative fuel vehicles" include plug-in electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and other motor vehicles propelled to a significant extent by an electric motor that draws power from any source that is not subject to certain fuel taxes.</summary>
