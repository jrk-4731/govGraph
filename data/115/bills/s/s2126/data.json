Specifically, this requirement shall not apply with respect to an audit report prepared for an issuer that:\n\n ceased to be an emerging growth company on the last day of its fiscal year following the five-year period beginning on the date of its first sale of common equity securities, had average annual gross revenues of less than $50 million as of its most recently completed fiscal year, and is not a large accelerated filer. An issuer shall\u00a0cease to be eligible for the\u00a0exemption at the earliest of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the\u00a010-year period beginning on the date of its\u00a0first sale of common equity securities, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which its average annual gross revenues exceed $50 million, or (3) when the issuer becomes a large accelerated filer."
