Such agreement shall require the fund to pay the costs associated with:\n\n conducting a periodic census, and inspecting the health, of the horses; maintaining records of the horses living in the wild and in confinement; conducting the removal and placement of horses and monitoring horses removed from the Currituck County Outer Banks; and administering a viable population control plan for the horses."
