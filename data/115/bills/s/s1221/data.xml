  <summary date="2017-06-06T14:25:33Z" status="Reported to Senate with amendment(s)">Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017

This bill declares that the United States supports the "Stimson Doctrine" and thus does not recognize territorial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, and Transnistria.

The bill: (1) authorizes FY2018-FY2019 assistance for the Countering Russian Influence Fund; and (2) prescribes fund use, including assisting those North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or European Union (EU) countries that are vulnerable to Russian influence or aggression to enhance their energy security, lessen dependence on Russian energy sources, and protect their infrastructure and electoral mechanisms from cyber attack.

The Department of State shall establish a pilot program for Foreign Service officer positions focused on governance and anticorruption activities in vulnerable NATO and EU countries.

The President shall submit annual reports to Congress regarding: (1) media organizations that are controlled and funded by the Russian government and affiliated entities, and (2) Russian influence on elections in Europe or Eurasia.

The State Department shall work with the government of Ukraine to increase Ukrainian energy security and production and reduce its reliance on Russian energy imports. Authorizes FY2018-FY2019 assistance to promote Ukrainian energy security.</summary>
