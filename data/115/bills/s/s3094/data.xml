This bill prohibits the U.S. Coast Guard from: (1) implementing the rule titled "Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)-Reader Requirements," and (2) proposing or issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking for a rule that would require the use of biometric readers for biometric transportation security cards.

These prohibitions end 60 days after the Department of Homeland Security submits to Congress an assessment of the transportation security card program.</summary>
