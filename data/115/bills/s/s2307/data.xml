This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require a developing country, as a condition for eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences, to establish in its law and practice:

 freedom of association; recognition of the right to collective bargaining; elimination of all forms of compulsory or forced labor; abolition of, and the prohibition of the worst forms of, child labor; elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation; and acceptable conditions of work regarding minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health. The Generalized System of Preferences is a U.S. trade program designed to promote economic growth in developing countries by providing preferential duty-free entry for certain products from designated beneficiary countries.

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative shall prescribe regulations necessary for the implementation of this bill.</summary>
