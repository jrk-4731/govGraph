This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student aid programs to annually certify with the Department of Education that the IHE's president and at least one additional member of the IHE's board of trustees have reviewed incidents involving the IHE's employees that were reported to the IHE in the last year involving domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The certification must include a confirmation that the president and any board member involved in the review did not interfere with or influence investigations or dispositions relating to the incidents.</summary>
