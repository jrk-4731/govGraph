  <summary date="2018-05-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Opioid Overdose Reduction Act of 2018

This bill limits an individual's civil liability for harm caused by the emergency administration of an opioid overdose reversal drug (e.g., naloxone) if the individual is one of the following:

 a licensed health care professional who prescribes or provides the drug to an individual who was educated on its administration; an employee or volunteer at an opioid overdose program who provides the drug, as part of such program, to an authorized recipient who administers it; or an individual who administers the drug after obtaining it from a health care professional or as part of an opioid overdose program, or administers it pursuant to a prescription, and was educated on its administration. This bill preempts an inconsistent state law that provides less protection from civil liability related to the administration of opioid overdose reversal drugs.</summary>
