  <summary date="2017-10-30T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">GSP Footwear Act of 2017 This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President to designate certain footwear as eligible for duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).

The President shall include in the next six annual reports to Congress regarding the status of internationally recognized worker rights within a GSP eligible beneficiary developing country a study on the state of the U.S. footwear manufacturing industry for the preceding year.

In conducting any study of the probable economic effect of providing duty-free treatment under the GSP to such footwear, the U.S. Trade Representative shall request the U.S. International Trade Commission to examine current domestic production of like or directly competitive footwear articles and to identify any such articles where domestic commercial production is likely to occur within the next year.</summary>
