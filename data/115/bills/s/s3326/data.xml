This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit certain lump-sum payments of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits from being included as income to determine if a taxpayer meets the income requirements for the premium assistance tax credit. The bill applies to lump-sum SSDI payments that are: (1) received during the taxable year, and (2) attributable to prior taxable years.

(The premium assistance tax credit is provided to eligible individuals and families to subsidize the purchase of health insurance plans on an exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.)</summary>
