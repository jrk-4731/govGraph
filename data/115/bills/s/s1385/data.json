Treasury shall also direct such representatives to seek to require the bank to:\n\n develop and implement efficiency improvements to streamline and accelerate the bank's project certification and financing process, and develop performance measures that demonstrate how the projects and financing approved by the bank are meeting its mission and providing value to the region near such border."
