  <summary date="2017-06-29T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 to modify the authorized uses of funds a county elects to receive under such Act to include:

 reimbursing the county for law enforcement patrols and evacuations that are performed on federal land; search and rescue preparedness training; and capital equipment, equipment maintenance, and other purchases related to carrying out search and rescue and other emergency services. A participating county may reallocate funds for a different use than authorized only after the 45-day public comment period has ended, at the beginning of which the county shall publish a description of how it proposes to use the funds.

The bill extends the authority for the initiation of county projects until the end of FY2019 and allows county funds to remain available until expended.</summary>
