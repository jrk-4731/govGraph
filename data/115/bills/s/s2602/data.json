The guidance must: (1) facilitate reviews associated with the deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration projects and carbon dioxide pipelines; and (2) support the efficient, orderly, and responsible development of the projects and pipelines.\n\nThe CEQ must also establish at least two regional task forces to: (1) identify permitting challenges that permitting authorities and project developers and operators face, and (2) improve the performance of the permitting process and regional coordination."
