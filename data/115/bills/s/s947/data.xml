  <summary date="2017-04-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Transparency Improvements and Compensation to Keep Every Ticketholder Safe Act of 2017 or the TICKETS Act

This bill prohibits an air carrier from denying the boarding of a flight by a passenger who has been cleared to board, without the passenger's consent, unless such passenger presents a safety, security, or health risk.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall revise federal regulations relating to oversold flights:

 to eliminate specified dollar amount limits on compensation provided to a passenger denied boarding involuntarily, and to determine whether limits on the number of seats oversold for a flight are necessary and, if so, to consider whether to impose such limits based on a percentage of seats available on the aircraft. The DOT shall prescribe regulations to require an air carrier to:

 check in its employee or that of another air carrier seeking accommodation on a flight at least 60 minutes before its scheduled departure, and specify on a passenger's itinerary and publicly post its policies with respect to oversold flights and requiring passengers to give up their seats to air carrier employees.</summary>
