The DOT shall prescribe regulations to require an air carrier to:\n\n check in its employee or that of another air carrier seeking accommodation on a flight at least 60 minutes before its scheduled departure, and specify on a passenger's itinerary and publicly post its policies with respect to oversold flights and requiring passengers to give up their seats to air carrier employees."
