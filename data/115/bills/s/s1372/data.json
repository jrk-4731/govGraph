These levels must be based on the cumulative health risks of lead exposure.\n\nThe FDA must report on lead in foods frequently consumed by infants and children, including levels of lead in different foods, sources of lead in food, and the FDA's actions and plans regarding reducing lead in foods and detecting lead. The FDA must make recommendations on reducing the amount of lead in foods."
