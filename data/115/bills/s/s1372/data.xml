  <summary date="2017-06-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Limiting Lead Exposure &amp; Advancing Detection in Children's Foods Act or the Limiting LEAD in Children's Foods Act

This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish: (1) a maximum level of lead permitted in fruit juices that is not greater than the maximum level of lead permitted in bottled water, and (2) a recommended maximum daily level of lead exposure from food. These levels must be based on the cumulative health risks of lead exposure.

The FDA must report on lead in foods frequently consumed by infants and children, including levels of lead in different foods, sources of lead in food, and the FDA's actions and plans regarding reducing lead in foods and detecting lead. The FDA must make recommendations on reducing the amount of lead in foods.</summary>
