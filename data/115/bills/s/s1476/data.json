    "text": "Countering Russian Missiles Act of 2017\n\nThis bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to submit annual reports on:\n\n the status of the Russian Federation's new SSC-8 ground-launched cruise missile, its capabilities, and the threat it poses to the European and Asian allies of the United States and U.S. assets in the region; whether the United States faces significant military disadvantages with the introduction of the SSC-8 to the European continent; gaps in the current U.S. missile defense infrastructure in Europe; gaps in capability that a new U.S. intermediate range missile, that is not compliant with the Treaty between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty), would address in Europe and Asia; and the time line for fielding, and the cost for deployment of, an INF range missile. The Department of State must submit an annual report that includes a plan: (1) describing how the United States will coordinate with its European allies to enhance missile detection and defense; and (2) recommending additional foreign military sales, financing, or international military education and training for such allies for strengthening missile defense capabilities.\n\nThe bill requires specified consultation by the President and Congress regarding Russian Federation compliance with the treaty.\n\nThe bill prohibits any funds from being made available or expended for any action that effects U.S. withdrawal from the treaty unless the President certifies that withdrawal is in U.S. vital national security interests."
