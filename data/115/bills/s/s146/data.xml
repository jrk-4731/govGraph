This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) ensure that each border security technology acquisition program that is a major acquisition program has an acquisition program baseline approved by the relevant acquisition decision authority; (2) document program program cost, schedule, and performance compliance; and (3) have a plan for each program to meet implementation objectives by managing contractor performance.

 DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall ensure that border security technology acquisition program managers adhere to internal control standards identified by the Government Accountability Office.

 DHS shall submit a plan for testing border security technology so that new border security technologies are evaluated to ensure: (1) compliance with relevant departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and (2) the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars.

"Major acquisition program" means a DHS acquisition program that is estimated by DHS to require an eventual total expenditure of at least $300 million over its life cycle cost.</summary>
