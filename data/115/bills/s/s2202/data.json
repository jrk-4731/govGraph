The Most Wanted List sets forth NTSB advocacy priorities. It is designed to increase awareness of, and support for, critical changes needed to reduce accidents and save lives.\n\nThe bill also requires the NTSB to: (1) expand requirements for providing services to families of accident victims; and (2) review, every five years, its previously issued safety recommendations."
