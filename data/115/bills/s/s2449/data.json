DOE shall also establish a pilot program to award grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities for job training programs that lead to an industry-recognized credential.\n\nGrant amounts are limited to $2 million for any one fiscal year. The federal share of the cost of a job training and education program using a grant shall be up to 65%, while the non-federal share may not be less than 50% cash."
