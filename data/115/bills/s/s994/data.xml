(Sec. 2) This bill amends the federal criminal code to modify an existing prohibition on intentionally obstructing, by force or threat of force, a person in the free exercise of religious beliefs.

The bill specifies that, with respect to the prohibition, a threat of force includes a threat of force against religious real property.

Additionally, it establishes a criminal penalty&#8212;a fine, a prison term of up to three years, or both&#8212;for a violation that results in damage or destruction to religious real property in an amount that exceeds $5,000.

Finally, the bill broadens the definition of "religious real property" to include real property owned or leased by a nonprofit, religiously affiliated organization.</summary>
