This prohibition does not apply to a clause contained in a settlement agreement or separation agreement that resolves legal claims or disputes under specified conditions.\n\nNotwithstanding signing any nondisparagement or nondisclosure clause, an employee or applicant retains any right that person would otherwise have had to report a concern about workplace harassment to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and other specified agencies and any right that person would otherwise have had to bring an action in a court of the United States.\n\nThe EEOC shall: (1) establish a confidential tip-line that supplements its existing process for submitting a charge of discrimination; and (2) provide for the development and dissemination of workplace training programs and information regarding workplace harassment, including sexual harassment."
