During the certification period, a participant in the program may continue to receive benefits without a formal review of eligibility.\n\n(The CSFP provides supplemental food to low-income elderly persons who are at least 60 years of age. Certification periods currently vary by state.)\n\nUpon the request of a state, the Department of Agriculture must approve a state certification period of more than year, if, on an annual basis, the local agency administering the program: (1) verifies the address and continued interest of each participant in receiving benefits; and (2) has sufficient reason to determine that the participant still meets the income eligibility standards, which may include a determination that the participant has a fixed income."
