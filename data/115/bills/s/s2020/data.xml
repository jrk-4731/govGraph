This bill requires the Department of Commerce to establish a Cyber Shield Advisory Committee to recommend (1) the format and content of Cyber Shield labels for covered products (i.e., consumer-facing physical objects that can connect to the Internet and collect, send, or receive data); and (2) the process to identify, establish, report on, adopt, maintain, and promote compliance with industry-leading cybersecurity and data security benchmarks to enhance cybersecurity and protect data.

In addition, Commerce must establish a Cyber Shield voluntary program to identify, certify, and label such covered products.</summary>
