 This bill expands authorities, programs, services, and benefits for military spouses and their families. Specifically, the bill:

 expands the authority for noncompetitive appointments of military spouses by federal agencies to include spouses of active duty military personnel or disabled or deceased personnel, requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to ensure that military spouses are aware of the My Career Advancement Account program and their eligibility to participate in it, facilitates child care services for military families, expands the period of availability of the Military OneSource Program for retired and discharged members of the Armed Forces and their immediate families, and provides transition assistance for military spouses. DOD must report to Congress on:

 methods to increase its participation in defense contracts that provide employment for military spouses; public-private partnerships to support and enhance the health, safety, welfare, and morale of military families; small businesses activities of military spouses on military installations; and an assessment of the effects of frequent changes of duty stations on employment stability of military spouses.</summary>
