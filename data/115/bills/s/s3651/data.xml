This bill directs the Department of Justice to study the effectiveness of retail theft rehabilitation programs. A retail theft rehabilitation program is an education program that a retailer offers to a shoplifter instead of reporting a theft to law enforcement.

Additionally, the bill states that a retailer may offer a retail theft rehabilitation program in accordance with state, local, and tribal law.</summary>
