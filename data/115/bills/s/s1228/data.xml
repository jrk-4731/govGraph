The Department of State, in coordination with the U.S. Agency for International Development and other relevant federal agencies, shall submit to Congress a comprehensive report on the national diplomacy and development strategy (NDDS) of the United States. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review of 2015 may be used to inform its development.

Beginning in the year after the initial report is submitted, the State Department shall submit an NDDS report: (1) by October 1 of any year in which a new President is inaugurated; and (2) in any other year, by 90 days after the development of a new National Security Strategy Report.

Each report shall set forth the NDDS and shall include a comprehensive description and discussion of:

 the leading worldwide interests and objectives of the United States, categorized as vital, highly important, or important; the leading threats, challenges, and opportunities associated with such interests and objectives; an overview of and a plan to utilize the diplomatic and development tools and sources of leverage necessary to address or minimize the threats and challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities; and an identification of any additional resources or statutory authorizations necessary from Congress to implement the NDDS.</summary>
