The council assists the OMB in supporting government-wide evaluation activities and policies. The bill defines \"evaluation\" to mean an assessment using systematic data collection and analysis of one or more programs, policies, and organizations intended to assess their effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nEach department or agency shall designate a Chief Evaluation Officer to coordinate evidence-building activities and an official with statistical expertise to advise on statistical policy, techniques, and procedures.\n\nThe OMB shall establish an Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building to advise on expanding access to and use of federal data for evidence building.\n\nOpen, Public, Electronic, and Necessary Government Data Act or the OPEN Government Data Act\n\nThis bill requires open government data assets to be published as machine-readable data.\n\nEach agency shall: (1) develop and maintain a comprehensive data inventory for all data assets created by or collected by the agency, and (2) designate a Chief Data Officer who shall be responsible for lifecycle data management and other specified functions.\n\nThe bill establishes in the OMB a Chief Data Officer Council for establishing government-wide best practices for the use, protection, dissemination, and generation of data and for promoting data sharing agreements among agencies. Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2017\n\nThis bill codifies provisions relating to confidential information protection and statistical efficiency."
