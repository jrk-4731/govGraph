The broadcast or distribution by a person of his or her visual image to one other particular person shall not by itself constitute consent for such image's broadcast or distribution by that particular person to any other person.\n\nThe bill also subjects to a court-martial a person who:\n\n intentionally engages in a course of conduct with the intent to cause harm through directing harassing communications at another specific person; and causes harm to such person or to such person's military unit by such communication."
