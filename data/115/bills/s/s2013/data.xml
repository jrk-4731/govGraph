This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to modify provisions related to residential mortgage loans. In general, a creditor that is a depository institution shall not be subject to suit for&#160;violating specified ability-to-pay requirements with respect to a residential mortgage loan if: (1) the creditor has consistently&#160;held the loan on its balance sheet, and (2) prepayment penalties&#160;associated with&#160;the loan comply with specified limitations. Similarly, a mortgage originator shall not be subject to suit for such a violation&#160;if: (1) the creditor is a depository institution; and (2) the creditor informs the mortgage originator, which informs the consumer, that the creditor intends to hold the loan on its balance sheet for the life of the loan.</summary>
