In general, a creditor that is a depository institution shall not be subject to suit for\u00a0violating specified ability-to-pay requirements with respect to a residential mortgage loan if: (1) the creditor has consistently\u00a0held the loan on its balance sheet, and (2) prepayment penalties\u00a0associated with\u00a0the loan comply with specified limitations. Similarly, a mortgage originator shall not be subject to suit for such a violation\u00a0if: (1) the creditor is a depository institution; and (2) the creditor informs the mortgage originator, which informs the consumer, that the creditor intends to hold the loan on its balance sheet for the life of the loan."
