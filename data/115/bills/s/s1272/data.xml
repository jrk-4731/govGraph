This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration, in prescribing regulations or standards related to unmanned aircraft systems, to:

 define, and limit the scope of, the preemptive effect of such regulations or standards; preserve the legitimate interests of state, local, and tribal governments (e.g., protecting public safety); preserve state, local, and tribal authority to issue certain reasonable restrictions on the operation of a civil unmanned aircraft system within 200 feet of the ground or a structure; authorize, only with a property owner's permission, the operation of a civil unmanned aircraft in the immediate reaches of the airspace above private property; and establish pilot programs with state, local, and tribal governments to regulate the operation of civil unmanned aircraft systems, coordinate enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations, and identify best practices.</summary>
