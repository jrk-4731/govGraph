Highlights: 

This bill provides FY2018 appropriations to the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice (DOJ), science agencies, and several related agencies.

The bill funds agencies with a wide range of responsibilities for issues such as: addressing violent crime, drug trafficking, financial fraud, terrorism, espionage, and cybercrime; conducting the census; forecasting the weather; managing fisheries; exploring space; advancing science; providing legal services for the poor; enforcing employment discrimination laws; and overseeing patents, trademarks, and trade policy.

The bill decreases overall FY2018 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies funding below FY2017 levels. Compared to FY2017 levels, the bill increases funding for DOJ while decreasing funding for the Department of Commerce and science programs.

The bill includes provisions that restrict or prohibit the use of funds for:

 the enforcement of certain restrictions and reporting requirements for firearms, bilateral activities with China by NASA or the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and preventing states from implementing their own laws legalizing medical marijuana or industrial hemp. Full Summary:
