This bill amends Part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to require the removal and foster care placement of a child to meet the requirements for foster care maintenance payments if the child has been placed with a parent residing in a licensed residential family-based treatment facility for substance abuse.

The bill revises requirements for grants to regional partnerships delivering services and producing activities designed to implement IV-E prevention services, improve the well-being of, and improve permanency outcomes for, children and families affected by heroin, opioids and other substance abuse. This grant program is reauthorized for FY2018-FY2022.</summary>
