This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a pilot program to award grants to states in order to assist individuals with the transition from substance use disorder treatment programs to independent living and the workforce. Eligible grant activities include outpatient treatment programs, care coordination services, and vocational training. HHS may award five-year grants to up to five states (based in part on specified unemployment and overdose data) and one-year grants to states and Indian tribes (based on criteria determined by HHS).

Additionally, the bill amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to include temporary housing services for individuals transitioning from substance use disorder treatment programs as qualifying activities for which states may use federal funds. The bill also amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to allow states to use federal funds for career and training services for such individuals, including career counseling, employee assistance programs, and educational resources for employers.</summary>
