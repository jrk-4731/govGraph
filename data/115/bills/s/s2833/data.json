(ARC provides revenue loss coverage by issuing payments to farmers when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is below a specified amount.)\n\nIn the case of country coverage, USDA must calculate payments using county data of the National Agricultural Statistics Service. If this data is unavailable, USDA must use comparable county data, as determined by the applicable state office of the Farm Service Agency."
