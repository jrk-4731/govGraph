  <summary date="2018-05-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill amends the Agricultural Act of 2014 to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to use certain data to calculate payments for county coverage under the Agriculture Risk Coverage program (ARC). (ARC provides revenue loss coverage by issuing payments to farmers when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is below a specified amount.)

In the case of country coverage, USDA must calculate payments using county data of the National Agricultural Statistics Service. If this data is unavailable, USDA must use comparable county data, as determined by the applicable state office of the Farm Service Agency.</summary>
