This bill amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the President to suspend a country's designation of beneficiary developing country for one year if that country does not meet the minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 as reported annually by the Department of State. Such designation provides a country with duty-free treatment of its goods to the United States.

The bill also provides a process for downgrade of a country's classification (after notification) of watch list countries named in the annual State Department report.</summary>
