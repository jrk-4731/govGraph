The FDA must report on the meeting and issue guidance regarding eligibility criteria for clinical trials.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on individual access to investigational drugs for serious conditions through the FDA's expanded access program (i.e., compassionate use).\n\nThe FDA must streamline review by institutional review boards of expanded access protocols for individual patients.\n\nThe bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the manufacturer or distributor of an investigational drug for a serious condition that is designated a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy to publish its expanded access policy not later than 15 days after the designation."
