This bill authorizes funding for FY2019-FY2024 to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the Know Before You Fly educational campaign or similar public informational efforts to broaden unmanned aircraft systems (drone) safety awareness.

The FAA shall initiate a review of the process for interagency coordination of C-UAS activity and the standards for operation of a C-UAS system. A "C-UAS system" is the counter-unmanned aircraft system for detecting, tracking, and defending against drones.

The bill amends the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 to include railroad facilities as fixed site facilities for purposes of prohibiting or restricting the operation of a drone near such facilities.</summary>
