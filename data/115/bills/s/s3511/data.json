A \"C-UAS system\" is the counter-unmanned aircraft system for detecting, tracking, and defending against drones.\n\nThe bill amends the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 to include railroad facilities as fixed site facilities for purposes of prohibiting or restricting the operation of a drone near such facilities."
