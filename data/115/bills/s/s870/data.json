    "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was\u00a0reported to\u00a0the Senate on August 3, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCreating High-Quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act of 2017\n\nTITLE I--RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE IN THE HOME\n\n(Sec. 101) This bill extends and expands the Independence at Home demonstration program, through which comprehensive primary care services are delivered at home to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions.\n\n(Sec. 102) A Medicare beneficiary who has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is receiving home dialysis may choose to receive monthly ESRD-related visits via telehealth, provided that the beneficiary also receives face-to-face visits periodically. Specified facility fees and\u00a0geographic requirements shall not apply with respect to the provision of such services via telehealth.\n\nTITLE II--ADVANCING TEAM BASED CARE\n\n(Sec. 201) Current law allows a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, until 2019,\u00a0to restrict plan enrollment to individuals who\u00a0are within one or more classes of special-needs individuals. The bill allows an MA plan to do so permanently, provided that the plan meets\u00a0specified applicable requirements.\n\nThe Federal Coordinated Health Care Office within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) shall serve as a dedicated point of contact for states with regard to special-needs MA plans for individuals who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\u00a0The CMS\u00a0shall establish a unified process for grievances and appeals for individuals enrolled in such plans.\n\nThe CMS must, with respect to special-needs MA plans for individuals with chronic conditions, convene a panel of clinical advisors to establish and update the list of chronic conditions that make an individual eligible for participation in such a plan.\n\nThe CMS shall, with respect to special-needs MA plans,\u00a0consider applying certain quality measures at the plan level rather than at the contract level.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report to Congress on state-level integration between the Medicaid program and\u00a0special-needs MA plans for individuals who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nTITLE III--EXPANDING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n(Sec. 301) The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation\u00a0shall expand testing of an MA value-based insurance model that allows MA plans to propose and design benefit structures that vary benefits, cost-sharing, and supplemental benefits with respect to enrollees who have specific chronic diseases. The test model (initially being carried out in specified states)\u00a0shall be\u00a0expanded to all states, and may not be terminated prior to 2022.\n\n(Sec. 302) Beginning in plan year 2020, an MA plan may provide certain supplemental benefits to chronically ill enrollees.\n\nThe GAO must report to Congress on the provision of such supplemental benefits to MA enrollees.\n\n(Sec. 303) Beginning in plan year 2020, an MA plan may provide certain additional telehealth benefits.\n\n(Sec. 304) With respect to the provision of telehealth services to Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries\u00a0at home\u00a0by certain accountable care organizations (ACOs), the home shall be treated as an originating site. In such a case, (1) specified geographic limitations shall generally not apply, (2) the CMS shall not pay an originating-site facility fee, and (3) the CMS shall not pay for services that are inappropriate to furnish in\u00a0a home setting. The GAO must report to Congress on the implementation of these requirements.\n\n(Sec. 305) Certain siting requirements applicable under the Medicare program shall not apply to telehealth services furnished after 2020 for purposes of evaluating an acute stroke. The CMS shall not, with respect to such telehealth services,\u00a0pay an originating-site facility fee to an\u00a0originating site that does not meet those requirements.\n\nTITLE IV--IDENTIFYING THE CHRONICALLY ILL POPULATION\n\n(Sec. 401) The bill\u00a0requires the CMS to: (1) allow\u00a0certain ACOs to elect prospective, rather than retrospective, assignment\u00a0of Medicare FFS beneficiaries; and (2) allow a Medicare FFS beneficiary to voluntarily identify an ACO professional as the beneficiary's primary care provider for purposes of the beneficiary's assignment to an ACO.\n\nTITLE V--EMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS AND CAREGIVERS IN CARE DELIVERY\n\n(Sec. 501) The bill allows certain ACOs to operate incentive-payment programs\u00a0for beneficiaries who receive qualifying primary-care services.\n\n(Sec. 502) The GAO must report to Congress on the establishment, under Medicare,\u00a0of a payment code for longitudinal comprehensive-care planning services.\n\nTITLE VI--OTHER POLICIES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR THE CHRONICALLY ILL\n\n(Sec. 601) The CMS must establish a process for Medicare prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsors to request, beginning in plan year 2020, standardized extracts of claims data for Medicare hospital and medical services.
