  <summary date="2018-05-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill provides that any sequestration ordered by the President under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is inapplicable to funding of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.)</summary>
