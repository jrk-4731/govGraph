 (Sec. 2) This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to contract with a nonprofit organization that accredits health care organizations and programs in the United States to investigate a VA medical center to assess and report deficiencies of the center's facilities.

The VA shall delegate such authority to the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) in which the medical center is located or to the director of such medical center.

 Before entering into a contract, a VISN director or a medical center director shall notify the VA, the VA Inspector General, and the Government Accountability Office in order to coordinate an investigation conducted pursuant to such contract with any other ongoing investigations.</summary>
