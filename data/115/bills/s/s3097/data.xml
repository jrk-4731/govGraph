The report must include an evaluation of: (1) whether there is significant over-reporting of non-employer business income due to underutilization of allowable deductions and other tax benefits; (2) the current tax withholding, reporting, and filing systems; and (3) changes over time in the earning of wage income and non-employer business income.</summary>
