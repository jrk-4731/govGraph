The study must consider and analyze certain factors, such as current and future trends regarding repetitive loss structures that are insured under the National Flood Insurance Program and constraints on buyout practices.\n\nThe GAO shall submit to Congress and FEMA a report on the buyout practices study and the feasibility of FEMA establishing an alternative buyout program."
