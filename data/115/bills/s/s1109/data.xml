  <summary date="2017-05-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act of 2017

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to extend through FY2022 support for nursing workforce programs and grants.

Eligibility for advanced nursing education grants is expanded to include education programs for clinical nurse leaders and all combined registered nurse and graduate degree programs. (Clinical nurse leaders are advanced generalist clinicians who apply research and coordinate care in order to improve outcomes for patients.) To be eligible for these grants, clinical nurse specialist programs must provide registered nurses with full-time clinical nurse specialist education that qualifies the nurses to provide a full range of care.

Programs for loan repayment and scholarships for nurses, loans for nursing faculty, and geriatric care education are extended through FY2022. Grants for increasing nursing workforce diversity are also extended through FY2022.

Nurse education, practice, and quality grants are extended through FY2022 and eligibility is expanded to include nurse-managed health clinics.

Grants for nursing career ladder programs are expanded to: (1) promote career advancement for individuals to become registered nurses or advanced education nurses; and (2) support internships and residency programs to encourage mentoring and the development of specialties.</summary>
