Any drone seized by DHS or DOJ is subject to forfeiture to the United States.\n\nDHS shall: (1) evaluate the threat from drones to U.S. critical infrastructure and to domestic large hub airports; and (2) assess the threat of vehicular terrorism and its activities to support emergency response providers and the private sector to prevent, mitigate, and respond to vehicular terrorism."
