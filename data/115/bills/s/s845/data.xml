  <summary date="2017-04-05T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Protecting Sensitive Locations Act

This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that an immigration enforcement action by the Department of Homeland Security or an individual designated to perform immigration enforcement functions may not take place at a sensitive location, unless: (1) the action involves exigent circumstances, and (2) prior approval was obtained from the appropriate official.

A "sensitive location" includes all of the physical space located within 1,000 feet of:

 medical treatment or health care facilities; public and private schools; scholastic or education-related activities; school bus or school bus stops during periods when school children are present; any organization that assists children, pregnant women, victims of crime or abuse, or individuals with significant mental or physical disabilities or that provides disaster or emergency social services; places of worship; funerals, weddings, or other public religious ceremonies; public demonstrations; federal, state, or local courthouses; or any domestic violence shelter, rape crisis center, supervised visitation center, family justice center, or victim services provider. The bill shall not apply to the transportation of an individual apprehended at or near a land or sea border to a hospital or health care provider for the purpose of providing such individual with medical care.

If an enforcement action is carried out in violation of this bill: (1) no information resulting from the action may be entered into the record or received into evidence in a resulting removal proceeding, and (2) the affected alien may file a motion for such proceeding's immediate termination.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall provide training to officers and report to Congress on any enforcement activity occurring at sensitive locations.</summary>
