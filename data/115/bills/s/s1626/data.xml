  <summary date="2017-07-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017

This bill requires the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to prescribe regulations:

 requiring flight attendants, pilots, aircraft maintenance technicians, and airport first responders to receive annual training on how to respond to incidents involving smoke or fumes on board aircraft, and the FAA must develop a standardized form&#160;for reporting&#160;incidents of smoke or fumes; requiring the FAA to conduct an investigation after a report is submitted about incidents of smoke or fumes on board aircraft; and requiring commercial air carriers to install and operate a carbon monoxide detector on each bleed air stream on the aircraft (bleed air is compressed air produced by gas turbines that is taken from the compressor stage and used for cabin pressurization and other purposes).</summary>
