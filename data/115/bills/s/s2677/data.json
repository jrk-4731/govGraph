An \"eligible project partner\" is a person who:\n\n is responsible for operating, maintaining, or repairing the unit; participates in the provision, including transportation, of coal or other materials and supplies to the unit; provides financing for the construction, expansion, repair, or operation of the unit; or leases the unit."
