 This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit through 2022 for a portion of the expenses for the operation or maintenance of a coal-powered electric generation unit, excluding expenses for coal.

The credit applies to taxpayers who own or lease an electric generation unit that uses coal to produce at least 75% of the electricity produced by the unit.

Taxpayers and certain public entities may transfer the credit to an eligible project partner. An "eligible project partner" is a person who:

 is responsible for operating, maintaining, or repairing the unit; participates in the provision, including transportation, of coal or other materials and supplies to the unit; provides financing for the construction, expansion, repair, or operation of the unit; or leases the unit.</summary>
