States may bring civil actions for a pattern or practice of a failure to provide such technology or options.\n\nThe bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make it unlawful for persons within or outside the United States, with the intent to cause harm, to intentionally interfere with call-blocking technology.\n\nThe FCC must report on whether the requirements of this bill have reduced unwanted calls to consumers."
