The system must:\u00a0(1) reduce critical dependencies on the GPS network; (2) ensure the availability of uncorrupted and non-degraded timing signals for military and civilian users if GPS timing signals are corrupted or otherwise unavailable; and (3) be land-based, operational\u00a0in 2 years, and capable of operation for 20 years."
