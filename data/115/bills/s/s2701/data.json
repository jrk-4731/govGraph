The grants may only be made to local governments in urbanized areas with populations greater than 50,000 or to stormwater management authorities in those localities.\n\nFEMA shall give priority to grant applicants in areas that: (1) are highly vulnerable to a sea level rise, (2) include a military installation or other national security facility, or (3) have a population highly vulnerable to urban flooding and have an uneven capacity for flood mitigation and response efforts due to socioeconomic factors."
