  <summary date="2017-11-02T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Dialysis Patient Access to Integrated-care, Empowerment, Nephrologists, Treatment, and Services&#160;Demonstration Act of&#160;2017 or the Dialysis PATIENTS Demonstration Act of 2017

This bill establishes a demonstration program for the provision of integrated care to Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Under the voluntary program, eligible participating providers may form organizations to&#160;offer&#160;ESRD integrated care models&#160;and serve as medical homes for program-eligible beneficiaries. Such a model: (1)&#160;shall cover medical and hospital services, other than hospice care, under Medicare; (2)&#160;must include benefits for transition into transplantation, palliative care, or hospice; and (3) may cover prescription drug benefits. An organization must offer at least one open network model but may also offer one or more preferred network models.

An organization shall return savings achieved under the models to program-eligible beneficiaries.

A beneficiary shall have the opportunity to: (1) opt out of the program, (2) make an assignment change into an open network model offered by a different organization, or (3) elect a preferred network model.

The bill establishes requirements regarding: (1) benefits for program-eligible beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicaid benefits, (2) program quality and reporting, (2) ESRD integrated care strategy, (3) program operation and scope, (4) beneficiary notification, and (5) payment.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must, before 2025,&#160;submit to Congress an interim report on the program.</summary>
