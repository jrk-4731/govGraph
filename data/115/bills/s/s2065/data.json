Such a model: (1)\u00a0shall cover medical and hospital services, other than hospice care, under Medicare; (2)\u00a0must include benefits for transition into transplantation, palliative care, or hospice; and (3) may cover prescription drug benefits. An organization must offer at least one open network model but may also offer one or more preferred network models.\n\nAn organization shall return savings achieved under the models to program-eligible beneficiaries.\n\nA beneficiary shall have the opportunity to: (1) opt out of the program, (2) make an assignment change into an open network model offered by a different organization, or (3) elect a preferred network model.\n\nThe bill establishes requirements regarding: (1) benefits for program-eligible beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicaid benefits, (2) program quality and reporting, (2) ESRD integrated care strategy, (3) program operation and scope, (4) beneficiary notification, and (5) payment.\n\nThe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission must, before 2025,\u00a0submit to Congress an interim report on the program."
