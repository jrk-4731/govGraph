Before making such conveyance, Interior shall issue to the Washington County Water Conservancy District or the state:\n\n a 250-foot right-of-way for the construction, maintenance, repair, and replacement of a buried water conveyance pipeline and the associated construction, operation, and maintenance of subsurface water recharge facilities identified as Pipeline 1; and a 150-foot right-of-way for the construction and maintenance of solar and hydroelectric generation and transmission facilities identified as Transmission Line.
