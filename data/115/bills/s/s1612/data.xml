This bill expands the definition of "highway safety improvement project" to include education, as part of an approved state strategic highway safety plan, subject to a specified funding limitation.

The bill also modifies the highway safety improvement program high-risk rural road safety rule to require a state to obligate additional funds for projects on high-risk rural roads if the fatality rate on such roads does not decrease (currently, if it increases) during a two-year period. If the fatality rate does not decrease and exceeds the national fatality rate on rural roads, then, as under existing law, the state must obligate 200% of the amount it received for high-risk rural roads in FY2009.</summary>
