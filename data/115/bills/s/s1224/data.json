A state, local government, or regional entity is eligible for such a grant if it is located in an area that has been declared a major disaster area within the previous five years.\n\nHUD's Office of Policy Development and Research must select and award annual grants to a single nonprofit organization having a national reputation for expertise in resilience research and capacity building to develop, establish, and operate a National Research Center for Resilience. The center shall provide grants to institutions of higher education or other nonprofit organizations to establish a Regional Center for Resilience in each of HUD's 10 regions to serve as regional research partners with recipients of resilience grants."
