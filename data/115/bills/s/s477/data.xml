  <summary date="2017-02-28T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act of 2017

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to replace the authorization for a National Congenital Heart Disease Surveillance System with a requirement for the Department of Health and Human Services, regarding congenital heart disease, to enhance and expand research and surveillance infrastructure, and to plan and implement a public outreach and education campaign. (Congenital heart disease is a condition caused by a heart defect that is present at birth.)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must conduct: (1) a study of congenital heart disease, from birth to adulthood, that considers health care utilization, demographic factors, and outcomes; and (2) an awareness, outreach, and education campaign regarding congenital heart disease. Data from the study must be made available to the public.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute must report on its ongoing research efforts regarding congenital heart disease, future plans for such research, and areas of greatest need for such research.</summary>
