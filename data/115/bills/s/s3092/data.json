    "text": "Emergency SNAP Lapse Act\n\n This bill amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program) funds from state agencies that do not provide sufficient funds to pay the state share of the administrative costs of the program.\n\nTo participate in SNAP, state agencies must submit annually to USDA a statement certifying the amount of funds committed by the state agency to pay the state share of the administrative costs for the year. If the state agency has not committed sufficient funds, USDA must notify the agency, provide a specified period of time to correct the failure, and withhold SNAP funds if the failure is not corrected.\n\nUSDA must use any funds that are withheld from a state to provide grants to private nonprofit entities within the state for the costs of: (1) providing food to individuals in need; and (2) administering the grants, including hiring additional personnel."
