  <summary date="2017-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Accurate Workplace Injury and Illness Records Restoration Act

This bill amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to specify that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) may issue a citation for a violation of workplace safety requirements within the six-month period following an employer satisfying the requirements. Current law includes a limitation period that prevents OSHA from issuing citations six months after the occurrence of a violation. Thus, this bill specifies that the statute of limitations is tolled if there is a continuing violation of the requirements.

OSHA must issue a rule that amends its record keeping regulations to clarify that the duty to make and maintain accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses: (1) is an ongoing obligation, (2) continues for as long as the employer is required to keep records of the recordable injury or illness, and (3) does not expire solely because the employer fails to create the necessary records when first required to do so.</summary>
