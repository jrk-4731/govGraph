This bill amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to revise the loan amount above which a real estate appraisal is required for the commercial real property securing a Certified Development Company loan. Specifically, the bill ties the amount to the federal banking regulator appraisal threshold. (Currently, an appraisal is required for a loan of more than $250,000.)</summary>
