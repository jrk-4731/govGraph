  <summary date="2018-05-23T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Increasing Access to Mental Health in Schools Act

This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to partnerships between educational agencies and graduate institutions to increase the number of school-based mental-health services providers employed by low-income local educational agencies (LEAs).

Grant funds may be used for specified purposes, including to provide student-loan forgiveness and tuition credits and to support recruitment, hiring, and training.

In addition, ED shall establish a program to provide student-loan forgiveness for individuals who: (1) are not, and have never been, participants in the grant program established by the bill; and (2) have been employed by low-income LEAs for five or more consecutive school years as mental-health services providers.</summary>
