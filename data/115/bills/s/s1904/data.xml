  <summary date="2017-10-02T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Smart Cities and Communities Act of 2017

This bill establishes programs for the implementation and use of smart technologies and systems in communities of various sizes. A &#8220;smart city or community&#8221; is one in which innovative, advanced, and trustworthy information, communication, and energy technologies are applied to: (1) improve the health and quality of life of residents; (2) increase efficiency of operations and services; (3) promote economic growth; and (4) improve safety, security, sustainability, resiliency, livability, and work life.

The Department of Commerce shall establish a regional demonstration grant program focused on facilitating adoption, and allowing measurement and validation of performance, of advanced smart city or community technologies and systems. Commerce shall also convene a working group to develop tools for evaluating the cybersecurity of smart city or community technologies.

The Department of Labor shall establish a pilot program to furnish competitive grants for technology-based job training and education programs that provide industry-recognized credentials.

The bill requires strong federal encouragement and support for private sector-led standards development activities.

The bill requires the establishment of a strategic international smart cities and communities trade program that includes trade missions to promote and assist smart-community activities, as by leveraging expertise in infrastructure development.</summary>
