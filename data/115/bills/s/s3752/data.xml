This bill requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to transfer certain property within the exterior boundaries of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that was acquired by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project to the Department of the Interior to be held in trust for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota. The land is located above the top of the exclusive flood pool of the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project.

The transfer of such land shall not interfere with any of the authorized purposes of such project, any project of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program, or any applicable law. The Corps of Engineers shall retain: (1) the right to inundate with water or cause erosion to the transferred lands as necessary for the operation of such projects; and (2) any land, structures, easements or other property interests necessary to carry out such projects.</summary>
