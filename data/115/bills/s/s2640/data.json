    "text": "Safeguarding American Families from Exposure by Keeping Information and Data Secure Act or the SAFE KIDS Act\n\n This bill prohibits an operator of a school's website from using personally identifiable information or material it acquired because of use of the site in order to target advertising to students from early childhood education through secondary school, or their parents, based on information obtained or inferred from students' online behavior, use of online applications, or such personally identifiable information. The bill exempts online advertisements that are based on a current visit or are in response to a student's request for more information or feedback, provided that information about students' online behavior is not collected or retained over time for the purpose of targeting subsequent advertisements.\n\n The bill prohibits operators from: (1) selling students' personal information to third parties; or (2) collecting student information to create a personal profile or for purposes unrelated to educational instruction, school collaboration, or administrative activities.\n\n The bill requires operators to implement information security procedures. It directs operators to delete certain student information that is not included in a student's education records: (1) within a reasonable time\u00a0after a request through an educational agency, institution, or program, or\u00a0from the student's parent; or (2) once the data has outlived the legitimate purpose for which it was collected."
