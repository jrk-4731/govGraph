Any substantial alteration of the data's contents shall be recorded in a log that is made available to the public in an open format along with the data.\n\n An agency may remove such data from public availability if:\n\n the agency determines that the data is too costly to maintain or does not provide sufficient value to the public, the agency publishes specified notice at least six months in advance of such removal, and the data is available for download on the worldwide public domain for at least six months before such removal. This bill shall not apply to such data that is required to be removed from public availability or altered under another provision of law."
