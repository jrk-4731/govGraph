This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to train health professionals to treat opioid addiction and other substance abuse disorders, including by providing medication-assisted treatment, through the use of technology-enabled models. (Technology-enabled models are distance health education models that connect specialists with other health professionals through interactive videoconferencing to facilitate case-based learning, disseminate best practices, and evaluate outcomes.)</summary>
