  <summary date="2017-07-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Genetically Engineered Salmon Labeling Act

This bill requires the market name of genetically engineered (commonly called "genetically modified" or "GMO") salmon to include "Genetically Engineered" or "GE" in front of the existing market name.

The Department of Health and Human Services must ensure that an independent scientific and technical advisory organization reports on: (1) the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) environmental assessment of AquAdvantage Salmon, and (2) each FDA environmental assessment in support of approval of a new animal drug application for a genetically engineered finfish intended for human consumption. Upon receipt of a report from the independent organization, the FDA must conduct a second environmental assessment of the fish, taking into account the report's findings. The approval of a new animal drug application for a genetically engineered fish does not take effect until the second environmental assessment of the fish is completed.</summary>
