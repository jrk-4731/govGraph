This access is in effect for five years.\n\nThe bill amends the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 to make permanent the expiring\u00a0FISA provision that allows wiretap orders that follow the surveillance target rather than the phone (known as \"roving wiretaps\").\n\nThe bill amends the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to make permanent the expiring FISA provision that revises the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include any non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or preparatory activities.\n\nThe bill amends\u00a0the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to make permanent title VII of FISA,\u00a0which allows the Department of Justice\u00a0and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to jointly authorize the\u00a0electronic surveillance of non-U.S. persons who are outside the United States.\n\nThe federal criminal code is amended to expand the categories of transactional records that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may request from wire or electronic communication service providers about a person or entity for an authorized investigation."
