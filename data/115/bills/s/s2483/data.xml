This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to states and Indian tribes to waive tuition and fees at community colleges. To receive a grant, states and Indian tribes must agree to waive tuition and fees at all their community colleges and for all eligible students.

The bill appropriates $1.5 billion in FY2019, an increasing annual amount through FY2027, and $15.7 billion for FY2028 and each succeeding fiscal year for grants under this community college program.

This bill also requires ED to award grants to four-year historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs) to waive or reduce tuition and fees for up to 60 credits for low-income students.

HBCUs and MSIs that participate must: (1) enroll a student body that contains at least 35% low-income students; (2) maintain or adopt reforms and practices to improve completion rates and student outcomes; (3) set performance goals; and (4) execute an articulation agreement with community colleges, if accepting transfer students.

It appropriates $61 million for FY2019, an increasing annual amount through FY2027, and $1.6 billion for FY2028 and each succeeding fiscal year for grants under this HBCU/MSI program.</summary>
