Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. Under current law, the PSLF program forgives the the balance of a borrower's student debt after the borrower makes 120 qualifying loan payments under specified repayment plans while while employed in a public service job. This bill expands the program to include comparable payments under additional repayment plans as payments that qualify borrowers for loan forgiveness under PSLF."
