NIDIS may:\n\n engage with the private sector to improve drought forecast and communication if the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration determines such partnership is appropriate, cost-effective, and beneficial to the public and the decision-makers specified in the Act; and facilitate the development of one or more academic cooperative partnerships to assist with NIDIS functions. NIDIS shall develop a strategy for a national coordinated soil moisture monitoring network.\n\nThe bill amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend through FY2023 certain activities related to the provision of agricultural and silvicultural weather and climate information."
