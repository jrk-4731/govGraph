This bill requires the Office of Personnel Management to develop a list of joint cyber positions (which are positions in the competitive service that require or provide experience with information technology, cybersecurity, or other cyber-related functions that relate to multiple agencies) that shall be distributed annually to federal agencies. Each&#160;agency may designate a joint cyber position as a rotational cyber position, which will allow an employee serving in a cyber position to submit an application for a competitive&#160;appointment to a rotational cyber position in that agency or another agency.</summary>
