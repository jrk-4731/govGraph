  <summary date="2018-09-12T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act of 2018

This bill permits an agency to determine whether a cyber workforce position in such agency is eligible for the rotational cyber workforce program. That program provides for certain agency employees to detail among rotational cyber workforce positions at other agencies.

Additionally, the bill requires the Office of Personnel Management to issue a Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program operation plan that shall provide policies, processes, and procedures for detailing employees among rotational cyber workforce positions at agencies.

The Government Accountability Office must assess the operation and effectiveness of the rotational cyber workforce program by addressing the extent to which agencies have participated in the program and the experiences of employees serving in the program.</summary>
