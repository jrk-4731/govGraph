  <summary date="2018-05-24T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act

This bill rescinds approximately $15 billion in budget authority over 2018-2028 that was proposed to be rescinded by the President under procedures included in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

(A rescission is legislation enacted by Congress that cancels the availability of previously enacted budget authority before the authority would otherwise expire. Under current law, the President may propose rescissions to Congress, which must be enacted into law to take effect. Congress may rescind all, part, or none of the amounts proposed by the President. If Congress does not pass rescission legislation within 45 days of continuous session of Congress, the President must make the funds available.)

The bill rescinds budget authority from specified programs and accounts within:

 the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. Agency for International Development. the Department of Transportation, the Department of the Treasury, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the Railroad Retirement Board.</summary>
