The JOM Program awards contracts to tribal organizations, schools, states, and others to support the cultural and academic needs of Indian students. The contract amounts are based on the number of students served.\n\nContracting parties must annually report to Interior on the number of students they serve. If they fail to submit the report, then Interior may not give them program funds for the next fiscal year.\n\nThe bill sets forth a process to revise funding allocations provided under the program.\n\n Interior must consult with Indian tribes and state and local education agencies that have not participated in the program to determine their interest in entering into contracts.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Education must determine how: (1) the regulatory definition of eligible student may be clarified for contracting parties, and (2) the program funding formula may be updated to ensure the full participation of contracting parties and provide clarity on the funding process."
