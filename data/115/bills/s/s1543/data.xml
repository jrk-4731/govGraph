This bill requires military departments to establish a confidential process, utilizing boards for the correction of military records, by which survivors of a sex-related offense during service in the Armed Forces may challenge the terms or characterization of their discharge or separation from the Armed Forces. Discharge review boards are authorized to refer certain applications for relief that involve, among other things, a sex-related offense to the physical disability board of review.</summary>
