This bill requires contracting officers of the Department of Defense (DOD), before awarding or renewing a contract for the procurement of property or services, including construction, valued over $1 million, to consider any identified violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) or equivalent state laws by the offeror or any subcontractors.

The bill requires DOD to: (1) shall establish policies and practices with respect to responsibility determinations for contractors, and (2) protect the rights of contractors to protest bids and appeal actions taken under this bill.
