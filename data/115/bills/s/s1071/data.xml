  <summary date="2017-05-09T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Duplicative Green Building Program Evaluation Act

This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to report on and make public the outcomes of specified green building programs administered by DOE and listed in the Government Accountability Office's "2012 Annual Report: Opportunities to Reduce Duplication, Overlap and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and Enhance Revenue."

DOE must conduct an analysis of whether any of the programs should be eliminated or consolidated and report on methods to improve the programs.

Within a year, DOE must identify which programs were specifically authorized by Congress and which are carried out solely under DOE's discretionary authority.</summary>
