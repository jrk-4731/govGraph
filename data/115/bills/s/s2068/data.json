Under the assessment, it shall study and describe in each project both the proposed action and a no-action alternative.\n\n The Forest Service shall establish an arbitration pilot program as an alternative dispute resolution process in lieu of judicial review for such projects.\n\n The Forest Service shall prioritize and carry out ecosystem restoration projects to accomplish one or more of specified objectives.\n\nA categorical exclusion is made available for certain forest management activities in order to: (1) expedite specified critical response actions, (2) meet forest plan goals for early seral and early successional forests, (3) improve wildlife habitats, and (4) thin forests.\n\nThe bill makes permanent USDA's authority to designate treatment areas that are experiencing an insect or disease epidemic."
