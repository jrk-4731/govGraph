Vessels listed in the Naval Vessel Register may not be homeported in a location other than in the United States or Guam for a period of more than 10 consecutive years.\n\n The bill imposes certain limitations on transition of enlisted training to Ready Relevant Learning block learning, modernized delivery, or similar approaches, and grants authority to treat military units as unavailable for deployment due to a significant readiness deficiency."
