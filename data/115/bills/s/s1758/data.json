If a person takes an adverse action against a consumer based upon a housing court record, the person must provide the consumer a free copy of the report.\n\nA person who willfully creates a housing court report that contains an inaccuracy is civilly liable to the consumer.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must: (1) issue regulations that direct tenant rating agencies to create a central source for consumers to obtain reports and submit disputes, and (2) report on tenant rating agency compliance."
