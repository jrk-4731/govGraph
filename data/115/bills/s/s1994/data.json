The Administrative Office of the United States Courts must establish a supervised release pilot program to reduce recidivism and improve substance abuse recovery.\n\nDOJ must evaluate reentry best practices and create reentry demonstration projects in judicial districts.\n\nThe bill amends the Second Chance Act of 2007 to make permanent and modify eligibility for an elderly offender early release pilot program.\n\nLieutenant Osvaldo Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act of 2017\n\nThe bill requires the BOP to allow a federal correctional officer to: (1) securely store firearms on BOP premises outside the security perimeter of the institution or in a vehicle lockbox, and (2) carry a concealed firearm on BOP premises outside the security perimeter of the institution.\n\nNational Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2017\n\nThe bill establishes the National Criminal Justice Commission."
