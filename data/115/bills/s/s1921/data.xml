This bill amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to provide additional authority for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to make and guarantee farm loans through the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

The bill modifies the FSA's loan programs to: (1) increase the amount of unpaid debt permitted per borrower under farm ownership and operating loans guaranteed by USDA, (2) extend and increase the authorizations of funding to make or guarantee farm ownership and operating loans, and (3) require the authorization levels to be adjusted for inflation beginning in FY2019.</summary>
