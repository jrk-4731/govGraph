    "text": "FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017\n\nThis bill amends the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to extend the Act through December 31, 2025.\n\nThe bill prohibits the intelligence community from intentionally acquiring a communication about a non-U.S.\u00a0entity if the communication contains a reference to\u00a0the entity but\u00a0is not from or directed to that entity (this kind of communications collecting is called abouts collection) unless the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)\u00a0submit to Congress a written notice of the intent to implement the authorization of such communications collection.\u00a0The notice triggers a 30-day congressional review period that requires Congress to pass specific legislation in order to prohibit the authorization of such communications collection. Information obtained about a U.S. person through an abouts collection can only be used against that U.S. person for specified criminal proceedings.\n\nThe bill allows the FISA court's amici curiae (lawyers who argue against the government's\u00a0FISA requests)\u00a0to participate in matters pertaining to abouts collection.\n\nDOJ and the ODNI must\u00a0create procedures and keep records pertaining to queries, which\u00a0are searches done\u00a0with data the government already acquired and use a specific search term for the purpose of discovering or retrieving content or metadata.\u00a0\n\nThe bill exempts the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board from certain open meetings laws.\n\nThe penalty for the unauthorized removal of classified documents or materials is increased to up to 10 years in prison."
