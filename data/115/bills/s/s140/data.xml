  <summary date="2018-01-10T15:09:06Z" status="Passed House amended">(Sec. 1) This bill amends the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to specify that settlement funds may be used for the planning, design, and construction of the tribe's rural water system in Arizona.

(Sec. 2) The bill amends the Act of August 9, 1955, commonly known as the Long-Term Leasing Act, to allow the Ohkay Owingeh pueblo and the pueblo of Santa Clara in New Mexico to lease their restricted fee tribal land (land that is owned by a tribe and has restrictions against alienation and taxation) for up to 99 years. Under current law, they may lease the lands for up to 25 years.

(Sec. 3) The bill amends the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to exclude Native American tribes and tribal enterprises and institutions on tribal land from requirements for employers under the NLRA. (Currently under the NLRA, employers may not engage in unfair labor practices and must allow employees to form unions, engage in collective bargaining, and take collective action.)</summary>
