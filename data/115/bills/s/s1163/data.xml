This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that the director of each VA medical facility annually certifies that: (1) the facility is in full compliance with all provisions of law and regulations relating to scheduling appointments for veterans hospital care and medical services, and (2) any official data on appointment wait times is accurate.

The VA may not waive any applicable provision of such laws or regulations.

If unable to make such certification, a director shall provide the VA with an explanation of any noncompliance and a description of compliance actions being taken. If a director does not make a certification for any year, each covered official may not receive specified awards or bonuses during the subsequent year. "Covered officials" are a facility's director, chief of staff, associate director, associate director for patient care, and deputy chief of staff.

The VA shall ensure that its directives and policies apply to, and are implemented by, each VA office or facility in a uniform manner.

 The following VA positions shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate: (1) Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, (2) Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services, (3) Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Benefits, (4) Deputy Under Secretary for Disability Assistance, and (5) Deputy Under Secretary for Field Operations.</summary>
