This bill authorizes the President to designate a private, nonprofit organization to be known as the Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund to promote private sector development through:

 the initiation and expansion of employment and profitability of private enterprises; the modeling, promotion, and dissemination of sound corporate governance and law-abiding Western business practices; the promotion of policy reforms to improve the business enabling environment and facilitate foreign and domestic investment; and the demonstration that private sector investment can be undertaken profitably. The Board of Directors of the fund should adopt the best practices and procedures used by investment funds authorized for the U.S. Agency for International Development through enactment of the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 and the FREEDOM Support Act.</summary>
