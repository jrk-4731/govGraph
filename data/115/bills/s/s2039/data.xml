This bill amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (FARA):

 to repeal an exemption from registration under FARA for agents of foreign persons and entities in the private sector who register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA); to require such agents, after initial registration under FARA, to file subsequent statements at the same time, and in the same frequency, as reports filed with Congress under the LDA; and to authorize the Department of Justice (DOJ) to issue civil investigative demands to compel the production of documents relevant to FARA investigations before initiating criminal or civil proceedings. DOJ must develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to improve FARA enforcement and administration. The DOJ Inspector General must review: (1) the development and implementation of a comprehensive strategy; and (2) the use, effectiveness, and potential abuse of DOJ's authority to issue civil investigative demands.

The Government Accountability Office must analyze the effectiveness of FARA enforcement and administration.</summary>
