The report must analyze the financial impact of those filing requirements and provide any recommendations on how to consolidate redundant filing requirements.\n\nAfter receiving the GAO's report, the FCC must initiate a rulemaking to consolidate redundant filing requirements and incorporate any GAO recommendations that would not violate the Administrative Procedure Act into such rulemaking or any ongoing rulemakings."
