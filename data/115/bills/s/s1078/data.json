Currently, the committee only makes recommendations on new drug applications.\n\nOnly the Commissioner of Food and Drugs may approve a new drug application or supplement to an application for an opioid against the recommendation of the committee. If the Commissioner approves a drug against the recommendation of the committee, the Commissioner must: (1) submit a report to Congress that includes the evidence regarding patient safety that supports the Commissioner's decision and a disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest of FDA officials involved in the decision; and (2) testify before Congress regarding the decision, upon request. Such a drug cannot be sold until the Commissioner has submitted the report."
