Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management may establish special pay rates.\n\nThe DHS Office of Inspector General must review the use of hiring and compensation flexibilities and determine whether they help meet hiring and retention needs in rural and remote areas.\n\nDHS must report to Congress on the number of requests it receives from other federal agencies for the file of an applicant for a position in the CBP that includes the results of a polygraph examination."
