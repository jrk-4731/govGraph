  <summary date="2018-10-10T12:33:47Z" status="Passed Senate amended">U.S. Customs and Border Protection Hiring and Retention Act of 2017 or the CBP HiRe Act

(Sec. 2) This bill provides hiring and compensation flexibilities to support the recruitment, relocation, and retention of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) employees in rural or remote areas.

Specifically, if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines there is a critical hiring need and a direct relationship between the rural or remote nature of an area and the difficulty recruiting and retaining CBP employees in that area, then it may exercise direct hire authority and pay recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses. Additionally, the Office of Personnel Management may establish special pay rates.

The DHS Office of Inspector General must review the use of hiring and compensation flexibilities and determine whether they help meet hiring and retention needs in rural and remote areas.

DHS must report to Congress on the number of requests it receives from other federal agencies for the file of an applicant for a position in the CBP that includes the results of a polygraph examination.</summary>
