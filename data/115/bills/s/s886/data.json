If the person exercising acquisition decision authority over a major acquisition program approves such program to proceed into the planning phase before such program has a DHS-approved acquisition program baseline, as required by DHS policy, DHS shall create and approve a baseline report regarding such approval and notify Congress.\n\nDHS, by one year after this bill's enactment and annually through FY2022, shall provide information to Congress on the board's activities."
