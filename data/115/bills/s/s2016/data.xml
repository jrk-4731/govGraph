  <summary date="2017-10-26T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">No Unconstitutional Strike Against North Korea Act of 2017

This bill prohibits the use of funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense or to any other federal agency to launch a military strike against North Korea or to introduce the U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities in North Korea before the date on which Congress declares war on North Korea or enacts an authorization of military strikes that meets the requirements of the War Powers Resolution and that is enacted after the enactment of this bill.

This prohibition shall not apply to military force used to: (1) repel an attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, its Armed Forces, or its allies; or (2) rescue or remove U.S. personnel.

The bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a conflict on the Korean peninsula would have catastrophic consequences and that actions and statements that increase tensions between the United States and North Korea should be avoided; and (2) the President should engage in talks with North Korea to reduce tensions and improve communication, initiate negotiations to achieve a diplomatic agreement to halt and eventually reverse North Korea's nuclear pursuits, and move toward denuclearization and a permanent peace in the Korean peninsula.</summary>
