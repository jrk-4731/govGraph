This bill qualifies certain airport-related projects (e.g., airport development and planning, terminal development, airport noise planning) for financing under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA). The TIFIA program provides credit assistance, direct loans, and loan guarantees to national or regional transportation projects.

The Department of Transportation may enter into an agreement to provide financing under TIFIA for an airport-related project until September 30, 2020, and may extend such deadline to March 30, 2021.</summary>
