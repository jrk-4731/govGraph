  <description>An amendment numbered 1 printed in Part A of House Report 115-677 to add clarifying language so only those who cause injury to a law enforcement officer with intent, not by accident, can be charged under the statute. It also amends the definition of law enforcement officer to assure correctional officers are covered by the definition.</description>
