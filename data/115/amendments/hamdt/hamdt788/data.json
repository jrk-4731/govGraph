Specifically, the amendment clarifies when the Attorney General can temporarily and permanently schedule a drug or substance to the newly created schedule A and prevents the Attorney General from permanently scheduling that drug or substance if the Secretary of HHS determines that there is not sufficient potential for abuse. The amendment also clarifies under what circumstances an applicant for a schedule A registration may continue to conduct research with such schedule A substance while their application is pending, among their research accommodations.",
